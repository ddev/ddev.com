00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I should turn on the transcription as well. Oh, it says it's on.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Um… okay.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
One of them recent ones didn't have transcription. Anyway, welcome everybody. Um, we're happy to have you here today.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
KFX, you're welcome to unmute and join in.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Um, at any time.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Uh, we're gonna do a contributor training today.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
on, um, improving, editing, adding blogs to ddev.com.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
is such an important community resource,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
That, uh, we…

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We really like to have people sharing their techniques,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
And their needs and their problems, and their workarounds.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Um, there, and fixing things when things are broken. So…

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Um, I'm gonna go ahead…

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And share my screen.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And see how we do here. I have, um…

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I only have the, uh, the regular screen, and it's kind of cluttered.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
So I hope things work out here. I don't have a way to see…

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Uh, people's chat or anything, so speak up!

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
If there's anything that I should see

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
or no here.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Uh, you can't see the Zoom components, though, right? Like, you don't see the participants on the screen.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Or do you?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Okay, good. Yeah.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
No, we see on the Chrome browser. Let's, uh, open it. Mhm.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
All right, thank you very much.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So, okay, but I can't use the Chrome browser because…

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Things in the way. Let's see if I can…

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Hide it…

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Hide floating meeting controls.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Now, how will I ever get them back? Okay.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Making progress here, maybe.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Uh, DDev.com,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
As you probably know,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
is, um…

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
where we have our…

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Yeah, let's go to the… we have…

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Our introduction to DDev,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Here, we have our Get Started.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Um, we have a link to the docs, and then we have blogs.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
But most of what's here

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
is the blog.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
And a lot of times, those things…

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
have a tendency to get out of date and need some help.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Um, and of course, we need

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
new ideas and new techniques there, and we always welcome contributors.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
to do that. So, that's what we're going to be working on today.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Um, contributing to Tdep.com.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Uh, D-Dev is an open-source community, and DDev.com

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
is set up to help that open-source community work. So,

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Uh, back in the day, this used to be a WordPress site,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And if you wanted to fix something, you had to open an issue, and somebody with permissions had to fix it.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
But today, you can click the link, you can click the

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000
pencil on it, you can open a PR against it. It's all a static website.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
And we're happy to have contributions.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000
And so it's much, much easier to make contributions or edits or improvements there.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
And, of course, we invite you to pursue

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Ambitious things, too,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Uh, Stas is often doing ambitious things.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
making pieces of the project.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
of the site work better, that kind of thing.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
So…

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:11.000
Speak up anytime, as always. Otherwise, I'll just keep blabbing.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
So, what we're gonna do, um, is show…

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
how you can fix errors. As you know,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Because you work in the tech world,

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
things get out of date and ugly, uh, pretty fast.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
So, I'm just going to open up this blog here,

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Setting up a Go development environment.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Which, um…

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
probably didn't get as much editing

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
as it could have.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
So…

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
You see, it says, um…

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Installing Go on different operation systems.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Instead of operating systems.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And it says, um…

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Here's Randy, IDE of Choices Goland.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
That kind of thing. And so…

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Let's fix at least those two things.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.000
So, I am going to go and say, edit this page.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
And we have noticed that there's a problem.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000
So, we can edit it,

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:24.000
I'm gonna just click the Edit This File button now that we're on GitHub.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
And because I'm a maintainer of this,

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
It's not going to insist on a fork.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000
But if you're not a maintainer in the maintainers group,

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000
On the DDevOg,

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000
you would have to create a fork, but it just walks you through that.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.000
There's really nothing to it.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000
So I'm going to say, edit it?

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000
And I'm going to change the…

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Update date… let me just see what the…

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000
correct way to do the update is modified date.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:07.000
So this is what we want here. We're going to add a modified date to it.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000
So, we'll update it to today's date.

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000
And…

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.000
So, here's one edit.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Installing Go on different operating systems.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000
And…

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.000
cloning the repository…

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000
The role of Make Docs,

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000
We're gonna say Randy's…

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
IDE of choice is Goland.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Um…

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000
It'll be interesting to see

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.000
whether some of this is getting pretty out of date.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:54.000
It doesn't look too bad to me.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Looks like we have the things that we wanted to do. I just wanted to demonstrate…

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Uh, those, uh, two things, and now I'm going to do a save.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000
On that. Um, so I'm gonna say commit changes.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:17.000
And if I weren't, uh, maintainer, it would ask me to do that, um…

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
It looks like…

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000
GitHub Copilot did a decent…

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000
a just decent title for us here.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:36.000
And I'm gonna give this, uh, branch, like we like to name them.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:43.000
And I'm gonna say proposed changes.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000
And that, uh, proposed changes is the same as

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.000
Open a pull request.

00:07:49.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Um…

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000
And I'm gonna create a pull request.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000
So,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000
There we have made our contribution, we have fixed the thing, it took us moments to do it.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:19.000
And in just a moment, it will have a preview ready for us.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:25.000
And we'll take a look at that. We'll let it work right now. It's working on that preview.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Uh, does that… does that all make sense?

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Stas, I know this…

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Very exotic stuff.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:34.000
But…

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Yeah, I usually don't edit the pages like this.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000
No, um, you know, I have started…

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000
On occasion, when I just see a typo,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
It's in the docs or here.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000
I do just click that, and it…

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:55.000
You know? And that way I get the job… I get it done faster than checking it out. Or maybe it's faster.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Or maybe I do it while I'm remembering it, which…

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
can be useful.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000
So…

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.000
So that, um…

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000
Oh, it didn't do what I…

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:13.000
If I had done a forked VR, which is not what the path that it took me on,

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:15.000
than it would have taken a couple of more minutes.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
But as it is, here's my…

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:22.000
new, um… here's my new…

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000
branch preview, I'm going to open the branch preview and take a look at it.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000
And I'm going to navigate here to the blog,

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.000
And I should be able to…

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Uh, search for it.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
go…

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.000
It's this one, and now it has, uh, updated today on it.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
And now it says, installing Go on different operating systems instead of…

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000
operation systems.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000
And it says Randy's IDE of choice is Goland.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000
So that's looking good. Now, I can take and edit that in the…

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:09.000
issue that we have here.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000
And then I can ask Stas…

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
For a review,

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000
And he'll probably approve it and pull it, who knows what'll happen then. But, uh…

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000
That's all it takes to fix an error.

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000
or an update, or anything else that you find or need there.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000
Um, that's… you just click that edit button,

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000
And go for it, and it is fine.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000
Eric, welcome!

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Feel free to chime in anytime.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
We don't have a…

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000
I'm saying hello to you! Hello!

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000
Oh, were you saying hello to me? Hello! How are you?

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000
Where are you in the world, Eric?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000
We're glad to have you here today.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.000
In Brooklyn, New York. Well, I've always been interested in DDAB. I'm a regular user of it. I'm so sorry I'm late, I just saw the listing for it.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:14.000
So I won't hold you up, but I think it's great, and we use it all the time, and I write, uh, custom applications using it, and it's just… the best.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.000
We're very, very happy to have you here and to have that feedback.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000
What we just did was…

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000
We found some errors in this blog post here.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
On DDev.com, and we edited them,

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000
Just by clicking the, uh, edit this page,

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:38.000
And that automatically led us to create a PR for it, because DDEV is a static

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
HTML website which is run on Markdown.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:46.000
And so we created a, um…

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
We created a PR for that.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000
And… who knows, maybe the PR has already been pulled. It's been approved!

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
But maybe that, uh, Stasadev…

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Fancy guy will actually pull it, and then it'll be live on the website. But that's all it takes.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:07.000
is click, do an edit, and there it is, it's, uh…

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000
It's being processed already on the website.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000
So, click the… this works on DDevs docs as well. There's a little pencil there.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And you can… you can quickly make an edit

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
And as Stas said, sometimes… I mean, if you have a non-trivial edit, you would not do that.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000
But if you have a trivial edit, sometimes…

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000
I will see an error in the docs, or something that could…

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:41.000
be stated just a little bit better, and I'll just click the edit button instead of checking out the whole thing.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Okay, so there's our first step.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:53.000
of just doing a simple change that… something that needs to be done, you know it needs to be done, you can do it in the web interface if you want to,

00:12:53.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Now, if we want to do a blog post or any other significant change,

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Um, we can do that, too.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000
It's, um, it's very, very straightforward to do.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000
And, um, we welcome you to do it.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So, Eric, for example, you probably have

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000
particular expertise

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
from your, uh, from the things that you do for your

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
custom sites, and…

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Sometimes you realize

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:32.000
that you're the expert in that territory, or that you have solved a problem

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000
that maybe not everybody knows how to do.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:44.000
And we encourage community participation and blog posts on that. If you look at

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000
If you look at the blog posts, you'll see a number there.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Um, that are not written by the maintainers.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Here's the tail scale one that went up recently.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Explaining how to use the Tailscale VPN.

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Uh, for, uh, sharing projects.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Um…

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.000
We had, uh…

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:11.000
We had this nice one, uh, that's…

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:13.000
Stas and me still.

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
But we had, uh, how to downgrade Terminus.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
So, Bill… Bill Ceramentis discovered

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:24.000
Um, he… he pioneered exactly what to do with Terminus.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:28.000
When they upgraded it and basically made it so that it wouldn't work with

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000
I think PHP 8.0.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.000
And so, there's an easy way to fix that in DDev, and he published it, and explained it. It's a little too…

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000
obscure a problem to deal with.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
Um, for putting it in the docs.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Because it… you know, it's a solution to a very…

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000
New problem to a very old

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.000
situation that's very niche.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Um, but…

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:00.000
A blog post is a great place for it and makes it quite discoverable.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000
on the internet. So…

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.000
He did… he did that, um…

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Garvin Hickling did it with the Legacy PHP application.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Bringing up an old, old…

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:14.000
PHP application, another great… another great topic.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.000
for specialized use of that.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:21.000
No, I saw that post. Very helpful.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Have you had to do that?

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Yeah.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.000
I have not, but, you know, it caught my eye. So, yeah, that's a good… and I assume it works fine, you know, I mean, I'm running…

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:42.000
One Drupal 9 on one of my DDev instances, Drupal 10, Drupal 11, you know, so it's very flexible that way.

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Let's see what he was actually doing. I think he was doing, uh…

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:48.000
He was doing a Type 03

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000
4.5. I think they're on 13 or 14 now.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.000
Wow.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:00.000
4.5, with MySQL 5.5 and PHP 5.5.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
pre.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Wow, I think that's ancient.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Yeah, and he got it going. Um, I think he used…

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Um… Ah, no, he did! He… he went and added a…

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:16.000
a service…

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000
For 5.5, and did… uh, he did PHP on a different service.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.000
Which is a good way to do it.

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000
I just did that for PHP 8.5, the same thing.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Um, but…

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Anyway, so we… that's the kind of thing, you know, that so often,

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000
All of us run into problems,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
And we solved them, and sometimes they're niche problems.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:48.000
And if we share those, they're going to be useful to somebody in the future, so…

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
We just encourage that. That blog post. The starting place

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.000
For a blog post is do open an issue

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000
So that Stas and I, or anybody else,

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:04.000
can make suggestions about, uh, what we think will make it the most…

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Uh, most consequential approach to it.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Um, and then you just check out the repository

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
For the website, and what I always do is copy a similar blog post,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:26.000
Um, if you haven't done one of these before, then you can add your author profile to

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
source content authors.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Let me just show you what I'm saying here.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.000
Um, so here's ddev.com.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.000
And I'm looking at it in Go land. It would look exactly the same.

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000
If you were looking at it in PHPstorm or whatever,

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Um, and…

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000
the, uh, the key elements for a blog

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
are in source…

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Here's source.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:56.000
And content…

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000
And… blog has all the blogs in it.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000
And the authors has all the authors, so…

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.000
There's nothing to the author besides

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000
using your, uh, your name there.

00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
And… giving a blurb.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:21.000
And pointing it at an avatar. The avatar can be, as you see here, he used his gravitar,

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Avatar here, Alberto used, um, one in the image directory.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Uh, Bernardo used…

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:33.000
one in the image directory…

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Um, Bill used something in his own site, et cetera, et cetera.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
So, they all… they'll work fine.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Um, so… but the blog, for example, I need to…

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Uh, do a blog.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000
So I'll just give an ex… actually, let's just… let's just create a blog.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Um, I need to do the…

00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:00.000
um, October newsletter for 2025.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
So what I'm going to do is open the DDev…

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
September newsletter.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.000
I can't see it here…

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000
But if I…

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Search for that in the files.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000
I should see it.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Data of September 2025.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:28.000
And so, uh, what I'm gonna do with this, and I'm not gonna follow it all the way through,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000
I'm going to copy this and make it the October newsletter.

00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Um, and I do have content lined up for that.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Um, but…

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000
I'm not gonna do it all right now.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
In the front matter.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
I'm not sure I'll add it to Git.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000
And I'm gonna do, uh…

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
I'm gonna replace September…

00:19:55.000 --> 00:20:02.000
With October,

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.000
And…

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:06.000
This one is obsolete, because we just…

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Those two are obsolete, because we just did them.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
We have the November one coming up. I hope to see you in November. We'll talk about

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:21.000
DDev with Windows, WSL.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
And…

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Let's just say that I'm ready to…

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:32.000
kind of ready to get started with this one. I'm not going to finish.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Um, doing what it has.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
But let's just say that I had finished that.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.000
I'm then going to…

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Um, create a PR for it.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000
And… I don't have to do anything more right now.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
in the, um…

00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.000
I don't have to do anything more right now with the author, because my author…

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000
entry is already there.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.000
And, of course, I have…

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:11.000
Plenty more to do in the content here, but this'll… this gives me a good start.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Maybe I'll even get to work on it later today.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.000
And let's open up the, um…

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:37.000
I'm gonna use regular…

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000
So here's the changes that we've made, um…

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Goland was happy enough to add that.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000
And I am going to…

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Check out a… I'm gonna do a git fetch…

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
upstream…

00:21:50.000 --> 00:22:10.000
And…

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
And so there I have it.

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:20.000
And I didn't open an issue for this. Like I said, the issue…

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:22.000
Um…

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:30.000
The issue would be a good place to discuss the content before it went in. I've been keeping that content in a Notion note.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:39.000
thinking about it, and uh… nobody else… maybe nobody reads the newsletter at all, but I'm usually the only one that adds content to it.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Um,

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:45.000
No, it's good. It's… it's really good. I also want to compliment you on the, uh, the deed of, um, documentation.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Whenever I have a question, I can just pop it into the Google, and I mean, the AI wants to go first these days, but then if I go to the DDEV site, it's usually got it right there, write the answer, just what I'm looking for, so… you know, good, good, you know, good work, good on you, you know.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Thank you very much, Eric. We do… we do work hard at it, and the community works hard at it, and when people raise a question,

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
in Discord, or Slack, or all the different places.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
We do take that as a sign that maybe it isn't good enough in the docs yet.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Um, and we do try to put it in there.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Um, how do you use the docs? Do you do a search first? Is that the first thing you do?

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:32.000
Yes, let's see, so… Yes, I mean, the go-to, you know, the search engine of choice.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Like, we're in this… we're in this changing world right now, so it's a little hard to say, but search engine of choice.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Or the browser of choice is always, for me, has always been Chrome.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
So hit the chrome. What we're now calling the prompt, you know, you type in the URL bar.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:59.000
And… and just put my… and it… over time, it just… it just evolved into just asking… asking the internet the question, I suppose that's the opening for AI to step in, step in as it has in such a big way.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:10.000
And that's… that's where I'll, um, uh… find anything that I need. Last time I had any problem with DDev, wow, it's a long time.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:21.000
You know, like, like something was stuck, or something was broken. I mean, the whole thing is configuration, so if you really get frustrated with it, just trash it all, and just start over.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000
Yep, that's the professional way, right?

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000
All right? Trash is… trash is the wrong professional term, right?

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:33.000
Dw delete, I shouldn't be saying.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Okay, so I'm going to go ahead and commit this.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Um, uh…

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000
Oh, I want the October…

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.000
And, you know…

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:54.000
I want the October newsletter…

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
starter.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000
And now I'm going to push that.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
And I'm going to push it to my fork,

00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Uh, because anybody can push.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
to an open-source fork. So my fork is, uh, named Arfe.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Um…

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.000
And then it gives me the link.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000
For a PR?

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:31.000
And, um…

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Let's see if the link comes out right. Oh, the link doesn't come out right because I was experimenting with DDevTest earlier.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Normally, the link would be fine. I gotta get rid of that other, uh…

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000
get rid of that other thing.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Um, so…

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
I'm gonna say starter for DDev.

00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:01.000
newsletter…

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000
October…

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
2025…

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:11.000
And it doesn't really need much more of the normal stuff than that.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000
And I'm going to say, create a pull request. And I'm doing this as an ordinary user, so this…

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000
This, as an ordinary user, these checks will run. We may have to enable them if they're… if it's your first

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:28.000
If it's your first PR,

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.000
But these normal things will run and create a preview

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000
So we can actually use the preview online.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000
I can also, while that's going on, I'll show you what I can do.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Um, I can, in the ddev.com directory, I can do a ddev start,

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:53.000
And it will… it will, uh, show me exactly how to, um,

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000
exactly how to

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
preview that on my local machine.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:05.000
So, I'm gonna do that while the other one is getting ready.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.000
the, um… it… we…

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Because community contribution is so important,

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
We do love to…

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
make it so that people can usually do things like this.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Um, so that they can see…

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Uh, things without straining at the markdown so that they can see

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000
What it really looks like,

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.000
on the website, and those kinds of things, because we do want…

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000
those community contributions.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.000
I am on a very…

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Slow Wi-Fi. You should have seen me at the Cake PHP thing today.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Telling them to do a DDEV start and pull all the images.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000
With 30 people in the room, so…

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:51.000
What technology do you work with, Eric, or framework, or CMS?

00:27:51.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Um, let's see, I'm a Drupal developer, um, so I run a large multi-site.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.000
We're glad to have you here!

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Uh, with Acquia. Um, for the government, so… you know, not exactly busy this week. So… so, you know… Yeah, well, but I, you know, I've been a fan of DDev since, you know, since the beginning, you know, it was like Lando, you know, in 2021, Lando was like, oh, this is great, this is great.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:25.000
But then I remember when I got, you know, the defining moment for me, I had already really switched over to DDEV and writing, you know, a custom application where I could make.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:32.000
One command and have the whole site built for me in DDEV and get it all ready. You know, based on my custom.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:45.000
You know, database and my custom code, and, you know, all the rest of it, and the composer and all the rest of it. Right, but the ones I was when I got this job on the multi-side, and I tried to load up Lando. This was 2021, so I assume Lando's gotten better since then.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:51.000
This was 2021, so I tried to load up the Lando on the big site that I run, which is, like.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:29:15.000
500,000 or so nodes, right? And 3 hours later, I'm still waiting for Lando to load, and I'm like, well, I have DDev skills, let me drop a DDev in here and see if it's going to get better. I had a slow computer back then, like an i7 or something like that, right? So I dropped DDev into it, just dropped it in, and then 18 minutes later, I had a website running on my local system. It was like, okay, that's the end of that discussion as far as I'm concerned. But I assume Lando's gotten.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Better. Yeah.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
But was that on… was that on a Mac, on a new…

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Was that on an Apple?

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Oh, uh…

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Yeah, who knows? This was old. This was… this was previous. This was like an ice, you know, in… in that, in that day, you know, like an i7, you know, you know, when I got that computer in 2000… uh, whatever, 15, 16, if it was a… it was a fast computer, but it wasn't a fast computer in 2021.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Then when I got this computer, which is a M3 Max with 48 gigabytes of RAM.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:59.000
I run all the DDevs on my local computer. I mean, excuse me, all the sites on my local computer at once.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Yeah.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Right, right, yeah.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000
And the computer wouldn't even know it. Right, just, just, you know, I want… I want this particular one, I write this one. I want this particular one, I write this one.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
You know, and that's all… that's all D-Dev, so it's really great stuff.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Back…

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Back in that time period, um, a number of people

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
had problems with, um…

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:26.000
you know, Lando was dependent on the Bitnami images, which refused to do…

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000
Um, uh, ARM64 images.

00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:32.000
And so, Landa was stuck on that for…

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
quite a long time, and of course,

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:37.000
I assume that Lando has had

00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000
An immense amount of pain now, because Bitnami…

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000
Quit the business. They…

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:44.000
They went private, so that is a terrible thing for Lando.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000
No.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Um, and it actually…

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.000
It has one slight effect on us.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:58.000
We use, uh, Bitnami images for our…

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:03.000
MySQL8.X images, or we used it as a base.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:10.000
So we're not in any trouble in the short term, because we build our own images, and we've built them against their…

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:13.000
their public backup, basically.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:17.000
But that Bitnami thing was a…

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Bitnami was a great set of images, and…

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.000
I don't… and I always thought that Lando's…

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000
Use of them was smart,

00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:29.000
But…

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:34.000
it handicapped them for a number of years, so I'm talking too much. Here we are.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000
It came up, it told us where the, um… it told us

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.000
where the HMR version of the URL is,

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
And this is locally, so I can open that now.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:48.000
And…

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:55.000
If I then remember how to get rid of this…

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:03.000
get rid of the thing that's in front of me that you can't see.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
And then I'll be able to show that to you.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Um, we can go to the blog,

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:15.000
And here's our October 2025 newsletter showing up in the preview.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:21.000
And I can click through to it and see everything that is not yet written in it.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.000
But we did update the contributor training so that it only shows

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Next month's training now?

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000
So that's, um, that's a step forward. So that's our local preview.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:39.000
But while we were doing that, and while we were chatting, the, um, the GitHub

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:41.000
preview came through for us.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:45.000
So, now it opened up, and this would work…

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.000
for any of you, it opened up a complete preview online

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
that anybody can use,

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:56.000
And so, if I open that now…

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000
And that gets updated every committee.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.000
Was it running… was it running tests, um, in the… in the interim?

00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000
It also ran tests, so it did, uh…

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.000
It ran, uh… it ran the test here, which does…

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:14.000
Um, prettier and, uh, text-lint.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
So it's just looking for simple,

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000
Um, simple grammar or non-standard usage.

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000
Um, it seems to whine about things that I wouldn't whine about, but it…

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.000
It's a step toward consistency anyway, so it ran the…

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.000
It ran the test on it, um, it, uh, it made sure that it could build

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Right.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:38.000
at all. I'm not sure that with a blog change,

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
You can break anything that way.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.000
that would really break the test. So I ran that, um…

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:51.000
we can, uh, go to that publicly built blog,

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000
And navigate to the actual newsletter.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000
And I normally take and put that

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000
into the review here,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Um, and say…

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
a quick… quick way for somebody to get to it.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
Um, this…

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.000
is not intended

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
to be…

00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000
in, uh, ready for review.

00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:24.000
At this point, I clicked the wrong button.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000
So I'm going to say convert to draft.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Because it won't be ready until I actually work on it.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.000
But it will become real, and there it is.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Um, and it's, uh…

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:41.000
We have created a PR, we've created a contribution, and done…

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:45.000
what we needed to do for that. So…

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:47.000
That's our, um…

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:57.000
That's our starting point for creating a blog.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:01.000
I guess we did everything on this page. We've done the, uh…

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:06.000
We've done the local preview, and we've done the pull request.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000
For the blog post,

00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000
And the… the README… let me stop there and see if there's any…

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Any questions or comments about what we just did?

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Would you be willing to talk a little bit about your text linting and your prettier thing, uh, steps in the testing?

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Sure, actually, we can take a look at them.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Um, that's a fine idea.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Um…

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000
So, if we go…

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
out here to, uh, the ddev.com repository,

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:46.000
And we go into the, uh, .github here.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:51.000
the, um… the workflows

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000
are the cloud…

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Cloudflare Preview Forks, which is for forked PRs. That's how…

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:02.000
forked PRs can get built without any secrets being disclosed.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000
But the normal workflow is done here in…

00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000
in test.yaml.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:12.000
So, uh, when we have a, um…

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000
When we have a pull request,

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Uh, or a… or a push on Maine.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
It goes, uh, and these jobs…

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
here are done, so…

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000
it checks out…

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Let me… slow me down if this is… this, uh, GitHub Action stuff is not familiar.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Yeah.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Following along so far, yep, thank you.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
And, uh,

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:44.000
Here, it installs dependencies that we have, then it does a text lint,

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Um, and TextLint is running against

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:50.000
a .text link RC that we have.

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:56.000
So, I'll show you that in a second. And then Prettier, which is just a formatter,

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Um, uh, checks the formatting.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000
And we have both of those tools.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000
in the local development environment as well.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000
So, if we go to the TextLintRC,

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000
Here's what it looks like.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:16.000
And it insists on…

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:20.000
You know, if I often use ARM64 in lowercase,

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:24.000
And it will be mad at me then, and I often use Bash as lowercase.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:32.000
then it will be mad at me then, and I won't get it right. Uh, I often type php myadmin with the capital P on the front.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.000
And it doesn't like that. So…

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Um, and these can be added with a simple PR as well. If we see things going into the content.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000
that are not that great.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000
And then the prettier

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Um, doesn't have…

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.000
a lot in it, but it… it does…

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Um…

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
It does…

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
have in particular…

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:10.000
There's not a lot in this one this prettier, um…

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.000
I'm not even sure what single quote false means. Do you know, Stas?

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:25.000
It's like maybe, uh, do not use single quotes. In text, replaces with double.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Yeah, maybe it just won't let you do that, yeah.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.000
What's that?

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Corey prettes them up. Right, instead of a straight… instead of a straight quote, it makes a, um, you know, a typographic quote.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Yeah, well, actually, we don't allow typographic quotes, so maybe that's part of it.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
We… we do the rendering, uh, to typographic quotes,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:51.000
on… on render, and don't allow it in the code.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:53.000
Because, um…

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000
They break all… those break all code!

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:07.000
We don't want them anywhere.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
I know. Uh, the, um…

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:10.000
The original, uh…

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Oh, yeah, no, I'm a typographer from way back, so I can tell you, yeah, you know, I'll give that up, just for simplicity's sake, you know, but…

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000
the original contributor, a wonderful, wonderful contributor, Matt, um, who…

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.000
made this astrocyte go,

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000
is very much a typographic

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
weenie kind of guy, you know, he…

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000
insists on things being perfect, and he wanted us… he originally…

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:33.000
was wanting, um, typographic quotes.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000
And I just, like, stumped my feet and had a, you know, had a fit.

00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Um…

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:45.000
But instead of that, he figured out how to render them typographically, which is…

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.000
A fine idea, yes. Do it at that level, fine, but don't accidentally put stuff

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
in my code, when people are copying and pasting and that kind of thing.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Right.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Oh, yeah. Particularly when you're learning, stuff like that can get so confusing.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Oh, yes, absolutely. But, uh, people who care about typography,

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000
I think it's very important, so it's great to have a, uh,

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:13.000
It's great to have a compromise there, and it was brilliant how he…

00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000
How he worked out that compromise.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Yeah.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Now, there are other things that can be fixed, and feel free to bring up anything, but the README here…

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.000
In DDev.com tells about the structure of this, and of course,

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Um, there is a link also

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.000
in our presentation,

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:36.000
to how Astro works, how this is…

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000
how this is set up, um…

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:42.000
What the project structure is here,

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000
And… local development,

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:51.000
Um, running it without DDev, running it with DDev, I always run it with DDev these days.

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:55.000
And I guess we should remove this switching from

00:40:55.000 --> 00:41:02.000
Um, and then managing content, this is what we're going over today.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000
And the…

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Here's text lint and Prettier, and how to use them.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.000
And then sponsor management is a common thing.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Um, we got a… we got a new $100 a month sponsor yesterday.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000
And Stas went right in and put them…

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:24.000
In, he found their… found their, uh, logo,

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.000
And put them in like this,

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
And, uh, that was a big win, and of course, it's a…

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000
It's an unusual and very pleasant day when we get a new

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000
sponsor at that level, so…

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Um, but that's… oh, and Short Links is another… it tells here about short links. We have…

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Short links for things like Discord.

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000
So, um, it's got…

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000
All the things that you need to know

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000
there about ddev.com in the README.

00:41:55.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Or you can edit it and add the things that you discovered that we needed to know.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000
So, uh, and of course, as I said earlier, you're welcome to…

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:14.000
fiddle with the astrocyte itself.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:17.000
Stas regularly finds things that he thinks

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000
can be improved, and he improves them.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000
And, uh, anyway, just basically, we appreciate you

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Uh, we appreciate the entire community and your contributions on this.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:36.000
Because it is a community, and we can work together to make these resources improve

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Over time, which is, uh…

00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Which is a great thing. So…

00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000
But the floor is open for any…

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Questions, comments? Um…

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000
We're really happy to have

00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Really happy to have you here, Eric. And we had a few more people show up. All right.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Glad to see you, everybody that came. Trolls came!

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.000
And… and Pierre Paul came. Excellent.

00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000
Glad to have you here. And we'll get this, uh…

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000
We'll get a blog post wrapped around this.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000
And, uh, put it up on YouTube pretty soon, too, so…

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Feel free to, uh, speak up if you have any questions or thoughts.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Or anything else.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
Hello to everybody from Madrid, where…

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:38.000
I was… I spoke to the PHP people today at their Cake Fest.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Um, they're having a… having a great time.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.000
Yesterday, when I looked at my… we flew yesterday, and I looked at my…

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000
calendar, and I said, oh no, this is going to conflict, I can't…

00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:55.000
you know, I thought it was gonna… I thought this was at 8 o'clock in the morning, which it is my time.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:02.000
In Denver, and it's… but it's at 4 o'clock here, so there was no conflict, so I can do this from the…

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:11.000
From the hotel room.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Well, without further comments…

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Sure appreciate you, and uh…

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Look forward to, uh, look forward to seeing you at our next

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:28.000
November 1, if you're interested in DDev on Windows, which is really fun.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.000
So…

00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000
Thank you.

00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Keyopics and Pierre Paul, and everybody have a great day.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Thanks so much.
