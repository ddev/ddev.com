It's still (almost) the start of the New Year 2025, and we try to clarify goals at the beginning of each year. We'd love to have your thoughts and opinions! Some of the things we [planned in 2024](2024-plans.md) aren't quite done yet, but we're working and planning and responding to your needs. 

At the DDEV Advisory Group's 2-hour [annual review/planning meeting on March 4, 2025](https://www.meetup.com/ddev-events/events/303197425/?eventOrigin=group_events_list), we'll talk about plans and priorities for 2025.

We'd love to have your input as daily users as we work through these this month.

(I expect to edit this blog post several times as people express their opinions.)

## Community

- **Continue outstanding user support** even with growth of our user base. This remains a key priority from last year, but we still need to involve the entire community (meaning you!) in all the places.
- **Begin formal governance for the DDEV Foundation**. Our talks about this in the Advisory Group haven't really gone anywhere, so I'll probably propose something like a 3-person board for the DDEV Foundation, where I retain operational control, but we have at least one other board member fully enabled on financial controls and payments.

## Sustainability and Finance

- **Improve our Marketing CTA and information**: The [ddev.com "Support DDEV"](https://ddev.com/support-ddev/) page says lots of things, but the financial CTA gets lost there. We need to make it completely clear that for the project to be sustainable, the community will need to support the two developers who are working full-time on it, and make clear the many ways that this can be done.
- **Continue to develop contributors and maintainers**: As the project grows, we need more skilled contributors and maintainers. (The only difference between those is that maintainers typically have a higher level of direct access to project resources, but as a wide-open source project, almost all interested contributors can accomplish almost anything without enhanced privileges.) In the last two years, we [quite a lot of contributor trainings](/blog/category/training), and anecdotes indicate that people are using those recordings and blogs for training, but the actual attendance at them was not impressive. I'm thinking that this year these topics should probably be addressed with screenshare recordings and updated blogs instead of calendar-scheduled events. Given the financial struggles in our contributors' world, I doubt that we'll be able to add paid maintainers in 2025, I'm most interested right now in the reasonable goal of retaining and paying the two amazing maintainers we currently have.

## Features and Initiatives

### Funded and Work-In-Progress Initiatives

- The TYPO3 Association has agreed to fund the [integration of XHGui into DDEV](https://typo3.org/article/four-ideas-to-be-funded-in-quarter-1-2025) as part of their Community Budget Ideas. Part of this work has already been done in the [ddev/ddev-xhgui](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-xhgui) project, and it must be completed by March 31, 2025.
- [Top-level Node.js support](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/customization-extendibility/#using-nodejs-as-ddevs-primary-web-server) as planned in 2024 has been committed to HEAD.
- [Web-based Add-on Registry](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/issues/6383) is a WIP and expected to land soon.

### Proposed Features and Initiatives

- We have applied to the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) but have more work to do. We have to have a list of proposed projects that potential mentees can take on. The features in this section would be possibilities. We'll also be looking for community mentors, and maybe some of you would like to sign up for being mentees via Google this summer!
- The TYPO3 community has a [Q2 Community Budget Ideas](https://typo3.org/article/call-for-community-budget-ideas-q2-2025) call out, and we plan to propose one of the ideas discussed here.
