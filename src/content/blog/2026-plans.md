# 2026 Plans and Notes

Every year we try to lay out a bit of a plan for the coming year.

One of DDEV's primary strengths is our connection to a wonderful community, so each year turns out a bit different than expected. As we listen to people's actual experience, we try to adjust. And of course as upstream changes bring new features and bugs, we get lots of fun things to work on that we could never have anticipated.

We look forward to your input as the year goes forward.

## Community

- **Community is core to our strength and growth**. We are committed to maintaining the outstanding support that we offer for free and keeping that communication line open. And we want to continue to grow the amazing corps of contributors who offer improvements to the DDEV ecosystem.

## Board of Directors

In 2025 we established [Board of Directors](board-of-directors-established.md), but now we have to learn what that means. The Board will have to establish itself, begin helping to determine priorities, and find its way to a strong oversight role. Here are a few issues to toss to the board early:

* Overall Marketing/Fundraising strategy, including Fundraising drive
* Consider spending more on AI (Higher level of Claude Code plans)
* Discuss and create AI strategy, including policy, guidelines, tools, etc.
* How many conferences to attend (and what conferences) and spending priorities

## Features and Initiatives

* Overall AI strategy for DDEV users. How can we support the community in its use of AI for web development? 
* Update macOS install blog + Xdebug usage blog (carried forward from 2025)
* AI Sandboxing as key DDEV feature (from github.com/orgs/ddev/discussions/7923)
* Consider MCP (for projects) as key DDEV feature
* Consider MCP for DDEV
* Integration of mkcert CA without use of external tool
* Start a project without ddev config, Consider offering ddev config --auto or ddev config when ddev start in a directory without config ddev#7976
* Explore using real certificates instead of mkcert
* Subdomains for extra ports/services instead of separate ports. (Prereq for some web-based setups like coder)
* Coder support for subdomains. Could codespaces use some proxy/redirect technique to route subdomains to main item, but have a header that determined how traefik would route it?
* Use a ddev proxy on host to allow commands like ddev list and ddev describe and ddev launch to work.
* MCP support (for ecosystems that are using DDEV, perhaps for DDEV itself)
* Explore moving mutagen completely into container (syncing between volume and bind-mount)


## 2026 Planning Additional Notes

### Recognized Risks

We are a very small organization, so we try to pay careful attention to the risks as we go forward. In many ways, these are the same as the 2025 noted risks.

- Key maintainer Stas lives in a very volatile situation in Ukraine, and none of us knows how to predict the future. Physical risks, communication risks, and financial transfer risks are always possible.
- Randy is not young and can always face new risks.
- The financial outlook for discretionary funding from agencies and hosting companies (and perhaps individuals) remains horrible.
- Any of our maintainers can become overworked or discouraged or can burn out. We take the risk of burnout and overwork very seriously and are careful to talk about them and try to prevent them.
