Open source software thrives on community collaboration. DDEV exists because developers worldwide contribute their time, expertise, and passion to make local development better for everyone. This post celebrates the contributors who make DDEV possible and explores what makes our open-source community special.

## The Power of Open Source

Open source isn't just about free software—it's about community-driven development where anyone can contribute, improve, and shape the tools they use daily. DDEV exemplifies this model:

- Over 3,300 stars on GitHub
- 680+ forks
- Active development from contributors across the globe
- A welcoming community in [Discord](/s/discord) with thousands of members

Every feature, bugfix, and documentation improvement represents someone investing their time to make DDEV better for everyone.

## Core Contributors Making a Difference

While many people contribute to DDEV, some stand out for their consistent, impactful work:

## Extension and Add-on Maintainers

DDEV's ecosystem extends far beyond the core project through extensions and add-ons:

### VS Code Extension

The [DDEV Manager VS Code extension](https://github.com/ddev/vscode-ddev-manager) provides a centralized interface for managing DDEV projects. Created and maintained by [Biati Digital](https://github.com/biati-digital), this extension became part of the official DDEV organization at v1.3.3, with additional contributions from tyler36.

### Add-on Ecosystem

The [DDEV add-on registry](https://addons.ddev.com) features official and community-maintained add-ons:

**Official Add-ons:**

- [ddev-selenium-standalone-chrome](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-selenium-standalone-chrome) - Browser testing with Selenium
- [ddev-redis](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-redis) - Redis cache and data store
- [ddev-browsersync](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-browsersync) - Live-reload and HTTPS auto-refresh
- [ddev-cron](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-cron) - Scheduled tasks in web containers

**Community Add-ons:**

- **Metadrop** - Multiple add-ons for Drupal development
- **Lullabot** - [ddev-playwright](https://github.com/lullabot/ddev-playwright) for Playwright test integration
- **OpenForge Project** - Frontend and build-focused tools

These add-ons demonstrate how the community extends DDEV's capabilities to meet specific workflow needs.

## Governance and Sustainability

DDEV's sustainability depends not just on code contributors, but on people committed to its organizational health. The DDEV Foundation is evolving its governance structure:

- **Randy Fay** - Lead maintainer, leading operational and strategic direction
- **Stas Zhuk** - Co-maintainer with full GitHub organization control, ensuring continuity
- **Mike Anello** - Board member and Treasurer for the DDEV Foundation
- **Andrew Berry** - Providing governance advice

DDEV's 2025 plans include [formalizing governance](https://ddev.com/blog/2025-plans/) with a three-person board to ensure financial oversight and move beyond the BDFL model toward more distributed leadership. This governance work, while less visible than code contributions, is essential for DDEV's long-term sustainability.
