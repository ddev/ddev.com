## Our Vision: Sustainability and Financial Stability for the Project

Improved governance is one of our key long-term goals for the project, and was a [key goal for 2025](2025-plans.md). We know that this will be an ongoing process that we'll have to grow into, and we invite your participation. We meet every two months as a group, and the entire community is invited. Subscribe to the [meeting announcements and summaries](https://github.com/orgs/ddev/discussions/categories/ddev-advisory-group) and [ask for a calendar invitation](/contact) if you'd like. These meetings are also announced in the monthly [DDEV Newsletter](/newsletter).

Of course the key long-term goal is sustainability in general. We don't want to depend on any single maintainer, and we want to ensure that DDEV can continue to thrive and grow for years to come. Financial sustainability is a key part of that, but just one part. Read more about our [path to sustainability](sustainability-for-ddev.md).
