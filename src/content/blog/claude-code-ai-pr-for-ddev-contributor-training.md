Here's our August 21, 2025 [Contributor Training](/blog/category/training) on using Claude Code AI for a DDEV PR:

## TODO

- [ ] Using CLAUDE.md, what to put in it, not to trust claude to respect it.
- [ ] Add links to resources
- [ ] link to presentation
- [ ] Overall strategy
- [] Task Master

## Key Ideas

* Good existing tests help keep the AI honest. Don't let it change tests to make them pass.
* Good static analysis keeps code consistent. DDEV has `make staticrequired` to check go and markdown consistency.
