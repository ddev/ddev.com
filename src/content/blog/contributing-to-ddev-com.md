## Key Topics

### Quick Edits via GitHub ([4:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-rsZ7SG_bg&t=251s))

The easiest way to fix errors or update content is to click the pencil icon on any blog post. This takes you directly to GitHub where you can make edits and create a pull requestâ€”all without checking out the repository locally.

### Writing Blog Posts ([12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-rsZ7SG_bg&t=773s))

Community blog posts are encouraged! Share your expertise, workarounds, and solutions. Start by opening an issue to discuss your blog post idea with the community. Then copy a similar blog post from `src/content/blog` and adapt it with your content.

### Author Profiles ([18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-rsZ7SG_bg&t=1080s))

Add your author profile to `src/content/authors/` with your name, first name, and optional avatar URL. The avatar can be from Gravatar, the image directory, or your own site.

### Local Preview ([26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-rsZ7SG_bg&t=1606s))

Run `ddev start` to preview your changes locally with hot module reloading at the URL shown in the startup output.

### Quality Checks ([35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-rsZ7SG_bg&t=2115s))

Every pull request automatically runs:
- **Prettier** for code formatting
- **Textlint** for content consistency and terminology

The linting rules are defined in `.textlintrc` and enforce consistent usage of terms like "ARM64", "Bash", and "phpMyAdmin".

### Preview Deployments ([32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-rsZ7SG_bg&t=1935s))

Each pull request automatically creates a preview deployment on Cloudflare Pages, allowing you and reviewers to see exactly how the changes will look on the live site.
