As we announced in [Recruiting Contributors and Maintainers](/blog/recruiting-maintainers/) we're actively trying to increase the DDEV community of contributors and maintainers. To do that, we're going to start a series of trainings, and we'd love to have you come. The trainings will include information on how to contribute by:

* Involvement in the issue queue and Discord channel
* Creating pull requests to solve known problems or provide new features
* Test new prereleases
* Understand basic Go programming techniques
* Set up a Go development environment using Goland or Vscode
* Run automated tests on your own machine
* Manage failed test runs and improve our tests
* Explore new test platforms for DDEV macOS and Windows automated tests
* Maintain and improve DDEV's documentation
* Maintain and improve ddev.com
* Participate in reaching out to DDEV's current and future financial funders
* Participate in marketing strategy and implementation
* Build and improve Docker images

Live training sessions will be held weekly on Tuesdays at 8am US MT, 5pm CET or CEST. The trainings will be recorded for everybody's benefit. *Sign up on the simple form below to get the calendar invite with zoom link.*
