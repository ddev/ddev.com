## Welcome to the DDEV Add-on Registry

We're excited to introduce [**addons.ddev.com**](https://addons.ddev.com), a central hub where the community can explore, contribute to, and enhance the collection of DDEV add-ons.

## Add-on Types

Add-ons fall into two categories: **Official** add-ons, which are supported by the DDEV team, and **Contrib** add-ons, which are supported by the community.
