## Welcome to the DDEV Add-on Registry

We're excited to introduce <https://addons.ddev.com>, a central hub where the community can explore, contribute to, and enhance the collection of DDEV add-ons.

The source code is available and your contributions are encouraged at <https://github.com/ddev/addon-registry>.

## Search the Add-ons

Need to find a specific add-on? Use the search field, and watch results update in real-time as you type.

## Sorting the Add-ons

Click on a column title to organize the entries based on that field. A second click will reverse the sort order, and a third click resets it back.

## Add-on Types

Add-ons fall into two categories: **Official** add-ons, which are supported by the DDEV team, and **Contrib** add-ons, which are supported by the community.

## Engage by Leaving Comments

Want to share your thoughts or feedback on an add-on? Scroll to the bottom of an add-on's page and click "Sign in with GitHub". We use [giscus](https://giscus.app/) to manage comments, making it easy to join the conversation by authorizing your GitHub account. You can also react to other comments or add your own insights.
