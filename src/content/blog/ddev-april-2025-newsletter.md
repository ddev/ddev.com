**Spring has Sprung in Palisade, Colorado!**

**DDEV v1.24.4** was [released](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/releases/tag/v1.24.4)** with the new [XHGui profiling feature](xhgui-feature.md) (funded by TYPO3 Community Ideas Budget!).


**DDEV Notes and News**

* [Thanks to our Amazing Sponsors](https://ddev.com/blog/sponsor-thanks)
* [XHGui Feature Makes Profiling Even Easier](https://ddev.com/blog/xhgui-feature)
* [Set up an existing WordPress multisite locally with DDEV (with Bonus Pantheon support!)](https://www.kalamuna.com/blog/setup-existing-wordpress-multisite-locally-ddev-bonus-pantheon-support)
* [Darren Oh: Zscaler, DDEV, and Colima](https://darren.oh.name/node/81)
* The TYPO3 Q2 Community Budget Idea for implementing mDNS in DDEV did not get enough votes in the community, so won't be funded this quarter.

**Thanks for getting the newsletter! We love to have this way to keep in touch.** If you're not getting it yet by email, please sign up at [ddev.com/newsletter](/newsletter).

**Funding DDEV to allow both maintainers to work full-time on DDEV**: _We need your help and your organization's help! Let me know if you need help getting this into your budget!_ Our key financial goal is to [fully fund @stasadev so he can work exclusively on DDEV](lets-fund-stas-maintainer.md). We've slipped back in recent months. We need about $3700/month in increased pledges from organizations and individuals. See [Full information about supporting DDEV](https://github.com/sponsors/ddev). We’re happy to invoice you, happy to [do a call discussing this](https://cal.com/randyfay/30min), and would love it if you’d include DDEV in your budgeting process for this year or next. (Our current status: We receive about $6000/month, have been spending about $7000/month. Bank balance is about $7,000, down from $9,000 last month, but both Stas and Randy got paid this month.)

**THANKS to all of you who are supporting DDEV’s path to sustainability** and who have gotten your organizations to do so.
