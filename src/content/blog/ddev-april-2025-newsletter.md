**Spring has Sprung in Palisade, Colorado!**

**DDEV v1.24.4** was [released](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/releases/tag/v1.24.4) with the new [XHGui profiling feature](xhgui-feature.md) (funded by TYPO3 Community Ideas Budget!). 

**DDEV Notes and News**

- [XHGui Feature Makes Profiling Even Easier](https://ddev.com/blog/xhgui-feature)
- [Thanks to our Amazing Sponsors](https://ddev.com/blog/sponsor-thanks)
- [DDEV at DrupalCon Atlanta](https://ddev.com/blog/drupalcon-atlanta-2025)
- [Set up an existing WordPress multisite locally with DDEV (with Bonus Pantheon support!)](https://www.kalamuna.com/blog/setup-existing-wordpress-multisite-locally-ddev-bonus-pantheon-support)
- [Darren Oh: Zscaler, DDEV, and Colima](https://darren.oh.name/node/81). (We'd love to have you contribute your own experience with packet-inspection VPNs in [this docs PR](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/pull/7061). Note that DDEV v1.24.4 a significant problem with using internet proxies was resolved; full documentation will be included in that PR.
- The TYPO3 Q2 Community Budget Idea to implement mDNS (multicast DNS) in DDEV didn’t receive enough votes, so unfortunately it won’t be funded this quarter. The proposed [mDNS feature](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/issues/6663) offers an alternative to the standard `ddev.site` DNS resolution. It’s especially helpful for users who experience issues with DNS, and it could also eliminate the need for DDEV to modify the `/etc/hosts` file in those cases. We still hope to explore this in 2025!

**We welcome your contributions to the blog!** A number of community members have contributed blog articles demonstrating their use of DDEV to solve problems, and we welcome your contributions. It's easy, it's just Markdown, and full instructions are at [the ddev.com repository](https://github.com/ddev/ddev.com).
