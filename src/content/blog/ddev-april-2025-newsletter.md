**Spring has Sprung in Palisade, Colorado!**

**DDEV v1.24.4** was [released](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/releases/tag/v1.24.4)** with the new [XHGui profiling feature](xhgui-feature.md) (funded by TYPO3 Community Ideas Budget!).


**DDEV Notes and News**

* [Thanks to our Amazing Sponsors](https://ddev.com/blog/sponsor-thanks)
* [XHGui Feature Makes Profiling Even Easier](https://ddev.com/blog/xhgui-feature)
* [Set up an existing WordPress multisite locally with DDEV (with Bonus Pantheon support!)](https://www.kalamuna.com/blog/setup-existing-wordpress-multisite-locally-ddev-bonus-pantheon-support)
* [Darren Oh: Zscaler, DDEV, and Colima](https://darren.oh.name/node/81)
* The TYPO3 Q2 Community Budget Idea for implementing mDNS in DDEV did not get enough votes in the community, so won't be funded this quarter.

**Thanks for getting the newsletter! We love to have this way to keep in touch.** If you're not getting it yet by email, please sign up at [ddev.com/newsletter](/newsletter).

**Great News: Sponsorship Level is Increasing!**. According to our [open sponsorship feed](https://github.com/ddev/sponsorship-data/blob/main/data/all-sponsorships.json) our total monthly average income went up from $7099 to $7639 since March 1, a $540 bump in one month. Wow, you're awesome, thank you! If your organization or you aren't on the bandwagon yet, [join us to help make DDEV sustainable](https://github.com/sponsors/ddev). GitHub Sponsors is great, but we do support contracts, invoicing, PayPal, anything that works for you! Our goal is $12,000/month, so we're more than halfway there.

**THANKS to all of you who are supporting DDEVâ€™s path to sustainability** and who have gotten your organizations to do so.
