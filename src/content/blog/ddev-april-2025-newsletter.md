**Spring has Sprung in Palisade, Colorado!**

**DDEV v1.24.4** was [released](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/releases/tag/v1.24.4) with the new [XHGui profiling feature](xhgui-feature.md) (funded by TYPO3 Community Ideas Budget!).

**DDEV Notes and News**

- [XHGui Feature Makes Profiling Even Easier](https://ddev.com/blog/xhgui-feature)
- [Thanks to our Amazing Sponsors](https://ddev.com/blog/sponsor-thanks)
- [DDEV at DrupalCon Atlanta](https://ddev.com/blog/drupalcon-atlanta-2025)
- [Set up an existing WordPress multisite locally with DDEV (with Bonus Pantheon support!)](https://www.kalamuna.com/blog/setup-existing-wordpress-multisite-locally-ddev-bonus-pantheon-support)
- [Darren Oh: Zscaler, DDEV, and Colima](https://darren.oh.name/node/81). (We'd love to have you contribute your own experience with packet-inspection VPNs in [this docs PR](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/pull/7061). Note that in DDEV v1.24.4 a significant problem with using internet proxies was resolved; full documentation will be included in that PR.
- The TYPO3 Q2 Community Budget Idea to implement mDNS (multicast DNS) in DDEV didn’t receive enough votes, so unfortunately it won’t be funded this quarter. The proposed [mDNS feature](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/issues/6663) offers an alternative to the standard `ddev.site` DNS resolution. It’s especially helpful for users who experience issues with DNS, and it could also eliminate the need for DDEV to modify the `/etc/hosts` file in those cases. We still hope to explore this in 2025!

**We welcome your contributions to the blog!** A number of community members have contributed blog articles demonstrating their use of DDEV to solve problems, and we welcome your contributions. It's easy, it's just Markdown, and full instructions are at [the ddev.com repository](https://github.com/ddev/ddev.com).

**Thanks for subscribing to the newsletter! We love to have this way to keep in touch.** If you're not getting it yet by email, please sign up at [ddev.com/newsletter](/newsletter).

**Great News: Sponsorship Level is Increasing!** According to our [open sponsorship feed](https://github.com/ddev/sponsorship-data/blob/main/data/all-sponsorships.json) our total monthly average income went up from $7099 to $7639 since March 1, a $540 bump in one month. Wow, you're awesome, thank you! If your organization or you aren't on the bandwagon yet, [join us to help make DDEV sustainable](https://github.com/sponsors/ddev). GitHub Sponsors is great, but we also do support contracts, invoicing, PayPal — anything that works for you! Our goal is $12,000/month, so we're more than halfway there. Special thanks to new $100/month sponsors [@fullfatthings](http://www.fullfatthings.com/), [@liip](https://www.liip.ch/en), [@andreas-anwesoft](https://www.anwesoft.com/), [@wearrudder](https://wearerudder.com/)!
