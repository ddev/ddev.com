## DDEV Training Starting Up Again!

We're going to do training again this season, all are invited. Some sessions are more focused on contributors and maintainers, and others at all users. First up this month will be a session on using Claude Code to implement a DDEV feature or fix a bug. This will be using DDEV as an example, but probably anybody who works with code anywhere will profit from the approach.

See the full schedule below.

## Events & Community

- **DrupalCamp Colorado**  
  I got to see old friends, meet new people, and attend great sessions that refreshed my Drupal knowledge at DrupalCamp Colorado.
- **Laracon US 2025: Younger, Bigger, Friendlier**  
  Since Laracon was right after DrupalCamp Colorado and in Denver I went to learn from the vibrant Laravel community. It was a big, highly produced event with lots of friendly people and immense emphasis on community. Folks seemed younger on average than in the Drupal world. I didn't learn a lot about Laravel, but there were great general sessions that inspired me to start using Git worktrees and some new AI techniques.
- **See Us at DrupalCon EU in Vienna**  
  Randy will be at [DrupalCon EU in Vienna](https://events.drupal.org/vienna2025) thanks to sponsorship from [Tag1](https://tag1.consulting.com) and [Platform.sh/Upsun](https://upsun.com). Please say hi. Let's talk about anything you might want to talk about. I normally do a bunch of Birds-of-a-Feather sessions.

## Governance & Roadmap

- **Informal Nominations for the DDEV Foundation Board**  
  At the upcoming [DDEV Advisory Group](https://github.com/orgs/ddev/discussions/categories/ddev-advisory-group) meetings we'll be implementing an actual Board of Directors for the DDEV Foundation. Would you like to nominate someone (or yourself)? Ping us via any of our [contact methods](/contact/).
