DDEV comes bundled with a predefined set of tools, Pantheon's `terminus` being one of them.
The latest releases of `terminus` are not compatible with older PHP versions like PHP 8.1, though,
so we needed to downgrade it inside DDEV's `ddev-webserver` Docker image.

This guide covers how to downgrade `terminus` and will also explain how to use the same technique to install
additional custom tools.

Please note there are many ways to install packages in a container. We will
cover [extra Dockerfiles](https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/extend/customizing-images/#adding-extra-dockerfiles-for-webimage-and-dbimage)
here, but also [check `webimage_extra_packages` and `dbimage_extra_packages` in your
`config.yaml`for more details](https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/extend/customizing-images/#adding-extra-debian-packages-with-webimage_extra_packages-and-dbimage_extra_packages)).

## Case study: Manually Downgrading Terminus

[Terminus](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/releases) dropped
support for PHP 8.1 in recent versions, but some of our
projects still use PHP 8.1. We had to downgrade the DDEV-bundled version of `terminus` for those
projects by using a custom Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# .ddev/web-build/Dockerfile.terminus
# Terminus 4 drops support for PHP 8.1 which we still need
ARG TERMINUS_VERSION="3.6.2"
RUN curl -L --fail -o /usr/local/bin/terminus https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/releases/download/${TERMINUS_VERSION}/terminus.phar && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/terminus
```

`terminus` is just an example here, it could be any command you wish,
[either because you are running an older PHP version](https://github.com/pantheon-systems/terminus/releases/tag/4.0.0)
or the bundled version [has a bug that ruins things for you](https://github.com/platformsh/cli/discussions/166).

## Installing custom tools

You can obviously use the same techniques to install a variety of custom tools:

```dockerfile
# .ddev/web-build/Dockerfile.fzf
# fooscript relies on fzf
# fooscript lists all your Pantheon projects using a fuzzy finder list
ARG FZF_VERSION="0.62.0"
RUN curl -s -L https://github.com/junegunn/fzf/releases/download/v${FZF_VERSION}/fzf-${FZF_VERSION}-linux_amd64.tar.gz | tar xvz -C /usr/local/bin/ && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/fzf
```
