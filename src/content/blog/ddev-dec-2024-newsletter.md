**Hello DDEV Community!** It’s always a pleasure to reach out to you at the beginning of the month. Here are some updates for you.

**DDEV v1.24.0** was released with lots of goodies, including PHP 8.4.1 with all extensions, as well as Xdebug. This is a major release with some deprecations and removals, please read the [release blog](release-v1.24.0-php8.4.md) and [release notes](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/releases/tag/v1.24.0).

**TYPO3 Community Budget Ideas:** DDEV has posted a community budget idea for TYPO3's [community budget process](https://typo3.org/article/budget-2025-ideas-for-quarter-1-2025-published-vote-now). We'd like to improve DDEV's xhprof and xhgui even beyond where [@tyler36](https://github.com/tyler36) has already taken the [DDEV xhgui add-on](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-xhgui) and incorporate it into core. If you're a member of the TYPO3 association you've gotten an email about voting on this, please vote for the DDEV proposal!

**DDEV Notes from around the web**

- Drupal lead Dries Buyteart posted [Installing Drupal CMS (or Drupal Starshot) using DDEV](https://dri.es/installing-drupal-cms-or-drupal-starshot-using-ddev).
- Drupal at your Fingertips contains loads of great DDEV advice, including how to set up Apache Solr, see [Drupal and Solr](https://www.drupalatyourfingertips.com/development#solr-and-ddev) (and lots of advice about other things including Xdebug).

**Fully funding Maintainer Stas**: _We need your help and your organization's help! Let me know if you need help getting this into your 2025 budget!_ Our key financial goal is to [fully fund @stasadev so he can work exclusively on DDEV](lets-fund-stas-maintainer.md). We’re about 30% of the way to that goal, but apparently due to market conditions, have been going backward in recent months. We need about $3700/month in increased pledges from organizations and individuals. See [Full information about supporting DDEV](https://github.com/sponsors/ddev). We’re happy to invoice you, happy to [do a call discussing this](https://cal.com/randyfay/30min), and would love it if you’d include DDEV in your 2025 budgeting process. (Our current status: We receive about $3000-$4000/month, spend about $4000/month. Bank balance is about $9,300, up from $9,000 last month.)

**THANKS to all of you who are supporting DDEV’s path to sustainability** and who have gotten your organizations to do so.
