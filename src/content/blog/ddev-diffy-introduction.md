[Diffy](https://diffy.website) is a visual regression testing tool that allows you to take screenshots of your website from different environments and compare them. For example, you can visually compare your production vs. development. Or your local environment vs development.

We help developers see how their code changes affect the site visually, quickly, and on multiple pages.

As it is essential to spot the changes as early as possible, we built an integration with DDEV so you can take screenshots from your local environment.

For that you need a few steps:

- create an account in Diffy, create a project, API key
- add a ddev addon `ddev get diffywebsite/ddev-diffy` and run `ddev restart`
- set API key, project ID in `.ddev/diffy-worker/.env` file
- run screenshots from local environment with `ddev screenshot` and see them uploaded to Diffy

Once you have screenshots uploaded you can compare them to any other set of screenshots. For example with screenshots from production.

Here is a [video walkthrough](https://www.loom.com/share/a3b750e32581458f9d2271969bba1bb8) for the comparing local environment with your production with the integration.
