At the simple level, DDEV is just a wrapper on Docker and `docker-compose`. Here's our [Contributor Training](contributor-training.md) explaining how we use Docker in DDEV, including the Docker images and containers and how they're related.

- What is an image? What is a container?
- Image construction, layers, and putting all in one layer again
- Use docs diagram
- Basic images
    - ddev-webserver
    - ddev-php-base
    - ddev-dbserver (so many flavors)
    - ddev-router
- ddev-webserver
    - Based on Debian 12 Bookworm
    - Why is ddev-webserver so big?
    - Additional layers added at `ddev start` to customize for the user.
        - .ddev/web-build/Dockerfile.*
        - .ddev/web-build/pre-Dockerfile.*
        - docs link
    - Why donâ€™t we have separate containers for nginx/php/mailpit/node.js?
- ddev-dbserver
    - Mariadb images are based on the upstream mariadb official images
    - MySQL images are sometimes based on official mysql images
        - They have no arm64
            - Use Ubuntu for mysql:8.0
            - Build xtrabackup ourselves (docs link)
            - Build our own images
        - Possible future with bitnami/mysql
    - Additional layers can be added with .ddev/db-build/Dockerfile.*
- ddev-router
    - Just traefik with an extra layer
    - Older nginx-proxy still available, but very old
