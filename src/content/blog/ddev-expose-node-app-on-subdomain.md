# Exposing a Node.js App Over 80/443 on a Subdomain in DDEV

Have you ever needed to run a separate Node.js application alongside your main site in DDEV, and serve it securely
over ports 80 and 443 on a custom subdomain? While DDEV has built-in mechanisms for exposing additional ports,
sometimes you need more control, especially if you want to expos it through a domain like
`frontend.example.ddev.site` instead of a port-specific URL. This is where Traefik, bundled with DDEV,
becomes incredibly powerful.

In this post, we’ll walk through how to configure DDEV and Traefik to proxy requests from a subdomain directly
to your Node.js app on port 3000 within the DDEV web container.

## Why Not Just Use `web_extra_exposed_ports`?

DDEV's' [`web_extra_exposed_ports` feature](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/customization-extendibility/#exposing-extra-ports-via-ddev-router) is great for making your service accessible via a specific port
(e.g., (`3000`)). However, it doesn’t magically set up a subdomain for you to use on standard web ports (80/443).
If you want `frontend.example.ddev.site` to map to your Node.js app over HTTPS, you need a reverse proxy rule.
That’s where Traefik comes in.

## Step 1: Update Your `.ddev/config.yaml`

In your project’s `.ddev/config.yaml`, define the project name and the additional hostname you want to use. For example:

```yaml
name: example

additional_hostnames:
  - frontend.example
```

_(Optional)_ You can still use web_extra_exposed_ports to expose the Node.js port if you want:

```yaml
web_extra_exposed_ports:
  - name: node-app
    container_port: 3000
    http_port: 3000
    https_port: 3001
```

However, for a subdomain over standard web ports, the critical part is the next step with Traefik.

## Step 2: Create a Project-level Traefik Configuration File

In your project's `.ddev/traefik/config` folder add a file named `frontend.yaml`. In `frontend.yaml`, you’ll define two routers—one for HTTP (port 80) and one for HTTPS (port 443)—and
a service that points to the Node.js app on port 3000.

```yaml
http:
  routers:
    # Router for HTTP (port 80)
    example-web-80-http-frontend:
      entrypoints:
        - http-80
      rule: Host(`frontend.example.ddev.site`)
      service: "example-web-3000"
      ruleSyntax: v3
      tls: false
      priority: 100

    # Router for HTTPS (port 443)
    example-web-80-https-frontend:
      entrypoints:
        - http-443
      rule: Host(`frontend.example.ddev.site`)
      service: "example-web-3000"
      ruleSyntax: v3
      tls: true
      priority: 100

  services:
    # The custom service that routes to your Node app
    example-web-3000:
      loadbalancer:
        servers:
          - url: http://ddev-example-web:3000
```

Here’s what’s happening:

- Routers: Each router inspects incoming requests. If the hostname matches `frontend.example.ddev.site`, it passes the request to the `example-web-3000` service.
- Service: Defines where to actually send the traffic. In this case, `http://ddev-example-web:3000` is the internal address of the web container running on port 3000.

## Step 3: Restart DDEV

Run:

```bash
ddev restart
```

DDEV will pick up your new Traefik configuration, and you should now be able to access your Node.js application at:

```bash
ddev launch https://frontend.example.ddev.site
```

No more messing with non-standard port numbers in your URLs!

## Wrapping Up

By leveraging Traefik's routing capabilities, you can expose any service running in the web container on standard HTTP/HTTPS ports and map it to a dedicated subdomain. This approach keeps your development environment clean, user-friendly, and closer to production-like URLs.

If you’ve followed these steps, your Node.js application will be served seamlessly over `frontend.example.ddev.site`.
