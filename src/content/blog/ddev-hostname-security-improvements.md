> **TL;DR**: The new binary `ddev-hostname` shipped with DDEV now takes care of `hosts` file editing when needed. `hosts` editing only happens when you use a non-`ddev.site` URL.

One of the core principles of secure software development is the **principle of least privilege**: give a program only the minimal permissions it needs to do its job. With DDEV v1.24.7, we've taken a significant step forward in applying this principle to how DDEV manages hostname resolution on your development machine.

**If you don't use an alternate top-level-domain (TLD) or custom FQDNs, you won't notice any changes here.** Read on, but DDEV will continue to work as it always has for most users.

## Why DDEV Sometimes Needs Elevated Privileges

Most of the time, DDEV projects work seamlessly with URLs like `https://yourproject.ddev.site` without any special setup. That's because DDEV maintains DNS records for `ddev.site` and all its subdomains that resolve to `127.0.0.1` (your local machine). As long as you have an internet connection, your browser can look up these hostnames automatically.

However, there are situations where DDEV needs to edit your system's `hosts` file (`/etc/hosts` on Linux/macOS or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` on Windows):

- When you don't have an internet connection
- When your DNS is broken or blocks `127.0.0.1` resolution (DNS rebinding protection)
- When you use custom hostnames with `additional_fqdns` that aren't under `ddev.site`
- When you've configured a `project_tld` other than the default `ddev.site` or disabled DNS with `use_dns_when_possible: false`

For a deeper dive into how DDEV hostname resolution works, see our detailed guide on [DDEV name resolution and wildcards](ddev-name-resolution-wildcards.md).

## The Security Challenge: Minimal Elevated Access

When DDEV does need to edit the `hosts` file, it requires elevated permissions (root on Linux/macOS, Administrator on Windows). This is the **only** thing DDEV does with elevated privileges—but from a security perspective, how we handle that elevation matters a lot.

Previously, the main DDEV binary—which handles containers, databases, files, and many other tasks—also had to manage hostname editing with elevated permissions. When you elevate privileges for one specific task (editing `hosts` files), you want to minimize what else that elevated process can do. The old approach meant a larger binary with more dependencies running with elevated permissions, increasing the potential attack surface.

## The Solution: Meet ddev-hostname

DDEV v1.24.7 introduces a new dedicated `ddev-hostname` (and `ddev-hostname.exe` for Windows and WSL2) binary that handles hostname management exclusively. This specialized tool follows the security principle of least privilege in several important ways:

### Minimal Capabilities

The `ddev-hostname` binary has been stripped down to do exactly one thing: manage hostname entries in your system's `hosts` file. It doesn't include Docker utilities, global configuration management, or the dozens of other features that the main DDEV binary provides.

### Reduced Attack Surface

By removing unnecessary dependencies, we shrunk the `ddev-hostname` binary significantly. More important, though, we eliminated dependencies on several libraries that were previously included in the main DDEV binary but aren't needed for hostname management.

Each removed dependency is one less potential entry point for security vulnerabilities in the elevated binary.

### Platform-Specific Security

The new implementation provides native elevation techniques for each platform instead of relying on third-party tools like `gsudo.exe` on Windows. This reduces external dependencies and gives us better control over the security model.

## Special Benefits for WSL2 Users

If you're using DDEV with Windows WSL2, you'll especially appreciate another improvement that comes with these changes. The new `ddev-wsl2` package provides the Windows-side binaries you need, including `ddev-hostname.exe` and `mkcert.exe`, directly within your Linux distro.

This means **you no longer need to install DDEV on the Windows side** when using WSL2. The `ddev-wsl2` package gives you everything you need for proper WSL2 integration with Windows hostname and certificate management.

To install it:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ddev-wsl2
# or sudo dnf install --refresh ddev-wsl2
```

This streamlines the WSL2 setup process significantly and ensures you always have the correct versions of these critical utilities.

## What This Means for You

As a DDEV user, these changes are largely transparent—your development workflow remains the same. But under the hood, you're now benefiting from:

1. **Better security**: Elevated processes now have minimal capabilities and smaller attack surfaces.
2. **Simpler WSL2 setup**: No need for Windows-side DDEV installation.
3. **More reliable hostname management**: Native platform elevation instead of third-party tools.

## The Bigger Picture

These improvements reflect our ongoing commitment to making DDEV not just powerful and easy to use, but also secure by design. By applying established security principles like least privilege and minimal attack surface, we're building a development tool that you can trust with your local environment.

## Getting Started

DDEV v1.24.7 with these security improvements is [available now](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/releases). If you're using WSL2, install the new `ddev-wsl2` package.
