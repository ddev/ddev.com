**Happy New Year DDEV Community!**

Our most important news of the month is both bad and good, about Platform.sh change in funding of DDEV:

- Our lead sponsor, Platform.sh, has decided to reduce its sponsorship level.
- Platform.sh will also transfer to the DDEV Foundation the "DDEV" trademark and the domains that go with it.
- Platform.sh will continue sponsoring DDEV at a lower but still generous and critical financial level. You can read all about it in the [change announcement blog](platform-sh-ddev-funding-changes.md).
- TL;DR: we need every organization and individual to step up their financial support in order to ensure DDEV's future.

**DDEV v1.24.1** was [released](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/releases/tag/v1.24.1) with minor changes.

**DDEV's TYPO3 Community Budget Idea was accepted!** TYPO3's [community budget process](https://typo3.org/article/budget-2025-ideas-for-quarter-1-2025-published-vote-now) is an outstanding process for funding community ideas. We'll be improving DDEV's xhprof and xhgui even beyond where [@tyler36](https://github.com/tyler36) has already taken the [DDEV xhgui add-on](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-xhgui) and incorporate it into core, and at completion the TYPO3 Association will fund the project for €7500, a fantastic contribution.

**Funding DDEV and especially to help Maintainer Stas go full-time on DDEV**: _We need your help and your organization's help! Let me know if you need help getting this into your 2025 budget!_ Our key financial goal is to [fully fund @stasadev so he can work exclusively on DDEV](lets-fund-stas-maintainer.md). We've slipped back in recent months. We need about $3700/month in increased pledges from organizations and individuals. See [Full information about supporting DDEV](https://github.com/sponsors/ddev). We’re happy to invoice you, happy to [do a call discussing this](https://cal.com/randyfay/30min), and would love it if you’d include DDEV in your 2025 budgeting process. (Our current status: We receive about $3000/month, have been spending about $3000-$4000/month. Bank balance is about $8683, down from $9,300 last month.)

**THANKS to all of you who are supporting DDEV’s path to sustainability** and who have gotten your organizations to do so.
