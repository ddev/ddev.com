**Happy New Year DDEV Community!**

Our most important news of the month is both bad and good. Our lead sponsor, Platform.sh, has decided to reduce and change its sponsorship amount, but also to transfer to the DDEV Foundation the "DDEV" trademark and the domains that go with it, and they will continue sponsoring DDEV at a lower financial level. You can read all about it in the [change announcement blog](platform-sh-ddev-funding-changes.md). But the TL;DR is that we need every organization and individual to step up their financial support in order to ensure DDEV's future.

**DDEV v1.24.1** was [released](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/releases/tag/v1.24.1) with minor changes.

**DDEV's TYPO3 Community Budget Idea was accepted!** TYPO3's [community budget process](https://typo3.org/article/budget-2025-ideas-for-quarter-1-2025-published-vote-now) is an outstanding process for funding community ideas. We'll be improving DDEV's xhprof and xhgui even beyond where [@tyler36](https://github.com/tyler36) has already taken the [DDEV xhgui add-on](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-xhgui) and incorporate it into core, and at completion the TYPO3 Association will fund the project for €7500, a fantastic contribution.

**Funding DDEV and especially to help Maintainer Stas go full-time on DDEV**: _We need your help and your organization's help! Let me know if you need help getting this into your 2025 budget!_ Our key financial goal is to [fully fund @stasadev so he can work exclusively on DDEV](lets-fund-stas-maintainer.md). We've slipped back in recent months. We need about $3700/month in increased pledges from organizations and individuals. See [Full information about supporting DDEV](https://github.com/sponsors/ddev). We’re happy to invoice you, happy to [do a call discussing this](https://cal.com/randyfay/30min), and would love it if you’d include DDEV in your 2025 budgeting process. (Our current status: We receive about $3000/month, have been spending about $3000-$4000/month. Bank balance is about $8683, down from $9,300 last month.)

**THANKS to all of you who are supporting DDEV’s path to sustainability** and who have gotten your organizations to do so.
