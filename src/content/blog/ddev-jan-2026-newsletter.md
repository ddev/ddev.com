As we kick off 2026, it's time to look back at what we accomplished together and share where we're headed next. The DDEV community continues to grow stronger, with contributions flowing in from around the globe.

## What's New

- **DDEV 2025 Review** → The numbers tell an impressive story: growth in adoption, features, and community engagement. [Read more↗](2025-review.md)

## Lots of new DDEV GUI experiments!

Many DDEV users love the [PhpStorm/IntelliJ DDEV Integration Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/18813-ddev-integration) maintained by AkibaAT and the [VS Code DDEV Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=biati.ddev-manager) by Biati Digital, but there are new experimental entries in the GUI manager space:

- **DevWorkspacePro** by damms005 is a commercial entry in the wrapper-GUI space that has had lots of energy applied to it. There isn't currently a free trial available, and it's a bit pricey, but see it at <https://devworkspacepro.com/>.
- **DDEVBar for macOS** → Klemens Starybrat built a native Mac menu bar app that makes managing DDEV projects simpler. [Check it out↗](https://klemens.ee/ddevbar/)
- **DDEV Manager GUI** → VonLoxx created another DDEV wrapper GUI. [Try it out↗](https://github.com/DDEV-Manager/ddev-manager)

## Help Us Out: Use HEAD

Want to help DDEV development? Consider testing with the HEAD version of DDEV. This helps us catch issues early. We think some advanced users with complex Dockerfiles may have hiccups with upcoming v1.25.0. It's easy, See [the docs↗](https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/developers/building-contributing/#testing-latest-commits-on-head) for instructions.

## Sponsorship Update: You Showed Up

When we shared the news about Upsun lowering their sponsorship, the community responded. In just one month, sponsorship jumped from 58% to 68% of our goal—a 10% increase that makes a real difference. Thank you to everyone who stepped up.

**Previous status (December 2025)**: ~$6,964/month (58% of goal)

**January 19, 2026**: ~$8,208/month (68% of goal)
