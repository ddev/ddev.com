## Help Us Out: Use HEAD

Want to help DDEV development? Consider testing with the HEAD version of DDEV. This helps us catch issues early. We think some advanced users with complex Dockerfiles may have hiccups with upcoming v1.25.0. It's easy, See [the docs↗](https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/developers/building-contributing/#testing-latest-commits-on-head) for instructions.

## DDEV Training Continues

Join us for upcoming training sessions for contributors and users.

## Sponsorship Update: Community Response Has Been Strong

The DDEV community has responded strongly to the need for increased sponsorship after Upsun lowered their support level. We're up more than 5% in just a month—thank you to everyone who stepped up!

**Previous status (December 2025)**: ~$6,964/month (58% of goal)

**January 19, 2026**: ~$8,208/month (68% of goal)

![DDEV Sponsorship Growth Chart](/img/blog/2026/01/DDEV-sponsorship-status-2026-01-19.svg)

If DDEV has helped your team, now is the time to give back. Whether you're an individual developer, an agency, or an organization — your contribution makes a difference. → [Become a sponsor↗](https://github.com/sponsors/ddev)
