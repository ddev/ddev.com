## What’s New

- **Randy is back from bikepacking!**  
  We covered [lots of territory out in the state of New Mexico](https://facebook.com/randyfay) and had a great time. I'll never forget though, laying in my tent when we had some coverage and watching the DDEV community continue on supporting each other so very successfully. And every support answer from Stas was exactly what I would have said. I'm proud and amazed by this wonderful community.
