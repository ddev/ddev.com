**Happy March!**

**DDEV v1.24.3** was [released](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/releases/tag/v1.24.3) earlier than planned for two major reasons: an upcoming Docker engine release was going to be incompatible with current Mutagen version, and the new `generic` web server type allows Node.js and other interesting possibilities. **We encourage you all to upgrade because of this upcoming incompatibility, thanks!**

**Open-Source For The Win**: See the details about how a future incompatibility with the Docker engine was pre-emptively caught and fixed, [Open Source for the Win!](open-source-for-the-win.md)

**Web-based DDEV Add-on Registry** is now live! Try it out at <https://addons.ddev.com> and check out the [introduction blog](ddev-addon-registry-introduction.md).

**TYPO3 Community Budget Ideas: Please vote!**: We [applied for the Q2 approval process](https://talk.typo3.org/t/implement-mdns-for-ddev-name-resolution/6119/4) to fund a great feature for DDEV, supporting mDNS as a domain-name resolution technique. If you're a member of the TYPO3 Association, you should have received an email to vote on this. We'd appreciate your vote!

**Platform.sh has transferred domain names to DDEV**: Thanks again to [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh) for their ongoing support. As a part of the process in [change of their support](platform-sh-ddev-funding-changes.md), they have transferred control of the `ddev.com` and `ddev.site` domain names to the DDEV Foundation.

**DDEV Notes and News**

- The DDEV Advisory Group [Annual Review and Planning Meeting](https://github.com/orgs/ddev/discussions/7031) is on Wednesday, March 5 (tomorrow!), and **all are invited**. The Zoom link is in the agenda link. We'll be looking at 2025 ambitions and 2024 review, we'd love to have you there!
- Randy presented on [Divide and conquer: A systematic approach to troubleshooting issues](https://www.fldrupal.camp/session/divide-and-conquer-systematic-approach-troubleshooting-issues) at Florida Drupalcamp. The full recording is on the link.
- [Installing Drupal CMS with DDEV](https://www.webwash.net/drupal-cms-v1-installation-and-demo/)
- [Vite is suddenly not working due to CORS error? üßê (DDEV)](https://dev.to/mandrasch/vite-is-suddenly-not-working-anymore-due-to-cors-error-ddev-3673)
- Docker has renewed DDEV's "Docker-Sponsored Open Source" membership, meaning that DDEV users don't have a pull limit on DDEV images on hub.docker.com. This is a great thing for DDEV. Thanks, Docker!
- We applied for the [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) but did not get accepted due to the high volume of applications and limited available slots. We'll try again in the future!
- We're working on integrating the excellent XHGui performance exploration GUI for Xhprof to DDEV. This work is being funded by the TYPO3 Community's Q1 Community Budget Idea, and need to be completed in March.
- The Gitpod that we have known and loved is shutting down. This affects DDEV contributors that have used it and makes [DrupalPod as it stands obsolete](https://www.drupal.org/project/drupalpod/issues/3500792). If you're interested in DrupalPod and will be at DrupalCon Atlanta, there is a Birds-of-a-Feather session scheduled on the path forward, 04:00pm - 04:30pm Tuesday, March 25, 2025.

**Funding DDEV to allow both maintainers to work full-time on DDEV**: _We need your help and your organization's help! Let me know if you need help getting this into your budget!_ Our key financial goal is to [fully fund @stasadev so he can work exclusively on DDEV](lets-fund-stas-maintainer.md). We've slipped back in recent months. We need about $3700/month in increased pledges from organizations and individuals. See [Full information about supporting DDEV](https://github.com/sponsors/ddev). We‚Äôre happy to invoice you, happy to [do a call discussing this](https://cal.com/randyfay/30min), and would love it if you‚Äôd include DDEV in your budgeting process for this year or next. (Our current status: We receive about $6000/month, have been spending about $7000/month. Bank balance is about $9,000, up from $6,000 last month (progress!).)

**THANKS to all of you who are supporting DDEV‚Äôs path to sustainability** and who have gotten your organizations to do so.
