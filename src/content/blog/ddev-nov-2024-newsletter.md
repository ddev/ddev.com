**Happy November from DDEV**! It's a beautiful fall here, but things are cooling down. We live in an agricultural area, so the first freeze is always an event.

**Contributor Trainings From October (Recordings and Blogs)**

* [Supporting people using `ddev debug test` and other tools](ddev-debug-test-contributor-training.md)
* [Using Tmate to Debug GitHub Workflows**](tmate-github-actions-contributor-training.md)

**DDEV Notes from around the web:**

- **[DDEV Release v1.23.5 Announcement](https://ddev.com/blog/release-v1235-auto-port-assignment). Lots of goodies in this latest release, including automatic port assignment and automatic time zone detection.
- **[Mauricio Dinarte (@dinarcon)'s DrupalCon presentation on DDEV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nPJC7BbiGNw&list=PLpeDXSh4nHjQOfQV-BUgoxHXlr4tHlhPO&index=16&pp=iAQB)**
- **[Open source maintainers underpaid, swamped by security, going gray](https://www.theregister.com/2024/09/18/open_source_maintainers_underpaid/)** We all need to be working on this class of problem!
- **[Sponsor MacStadium's Open-Source Spotlight on DDEV](https://www.macstadium.com/blog/mac-open-source-hosting-spotlight-ddev)**
- **[Vite in Practice (TYPO3)](https://docs.typo3.org/p/praetorius/vite-asset-collector/main/en-us/)**
- **[Working with Vite in DDEV](https://ddev.com/blog/working-with-vite-in-ddev/)** continues to be updated and maintained by the fabulous @m_andrash.
- 

**Fully funding Maintainer Stas**: Our key financial goal is to [fully fund @stasadev so he can work exclusively on DDEV](https://ddev.com/blog/lets-fund-stas-maintainer/). We’re about 35% of the way to that goal, but have not been making progress on that in recent months. We need about $3000/month in increased pledges from organizations and individuals. See [Full information about supporting DDEV](https://github.com/sponsors/ddev). We’re happy to invoice you, happy to [do a call discussing this](https://cal.com/randyfay/30min), and would love it if you’d include DDEV in your 2025 budgeting process. (Our current status: We receive about $4000-$5000/month, spend about $6000/month. Bank balance is about $13,000, down from $15,000 last month.)

**THANKS to all of you who are supporting DDEV’s path to sustainability** and who have gotten your organizations to do so.

Want to keep up as the month goes along? Follow our [blog](https://ddev.com/blog/), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/ddev-foundation), [Mastodon](https://fosstodon.org/@ddev), [X,](https://x.com/randyfay) and join us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/5wjP76mBJD).

Happy November from Randy Fay, DDEV Project Lead.
