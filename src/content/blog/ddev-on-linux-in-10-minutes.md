## What Happens in This Screencast

Here's what happens in this screencast. You can do it yourself in just a few minutes. We're using [DDEV's get-started](/get-started), but of course there is far more detail in the [DDEV docs](https://docs.ddev.com), explaining how to use other distros or other install techniques.

1. Install Docker CE. Use the `apt` repository technique from [Docker's docs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/#install-using-the-repository).

- Do the post-install one-time action:
  ```bash
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
  ```
- We could log out and log back in, but instead for now:
  ```bash
  newgrp docker
  ```

2. Install DDEV, using the `apt` repository technique from [get-started](/get-started).

- `ddev --version` shows us being working fine with current stable.

3. One-time `mkcert -install` helps your browser trust DDEV's HTTPS certificates.
4. Check out a project. I used [rfay/d11](https://github.com/rfay/d11), a trivial demo Drupal 11 project. (DDEV's [quickstarts show many different project types](https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/quickstart/) with quick startup.)
5. `ddev config` the project. Most of the time you can take the defaults. But most of use use a non-interactive command like `ddev config --project-type=drupal11 --docroot=web`.
6. `ddev start` the project. The first time on a new system you get the downloading of the Docker images.
7. `ddev composer install` for most projects
8. `ddev launch` and install with the web UI. On another project I might have used `ddev import-db` to load a database dump instead of doing an install.
9. `sudo snap install --classic phpstorm`
10. Open the project and set a breakpoint in `web/index.php`.
11. Click the "Listen for PHP Debug Connection" button in PhpStorm.
12. `ddev xdebug on`
13. Visit the site in the browser. PhpStorm wakes up and asks us to map the code from the host/workstation side to the mount point in the container. The default usually works.
14. Debug, step over, step in, view variables, etc.

## Key Things to Know

- **Use your own IDE, including VS Code:** I used PhpStorm here, but [VS Code works great](https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/debugging-profiling/step-debugging/#ide-setup).
- **This demo used Ubuntu, but people use lots of distros:** The differences for major platforms are shown in the docs, but the ideas are all the same, and people use all of them, including other Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch Linux distros.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** DDEV works the same on macOS, Linux, Traditional Windows, and WSL2, see [Getting Started](/get-started). Your whole team can work on their preferred environment without friction. See [DDEV on Windows in 10 Minutes](watch-new-windows-installer.md) and [DDEV on macOS from Scratch](watch-ddev-local-from-scratch-with-macos.md).
- **Support for almost any PHP-based project and many Node.js environments** DDEV supports development of [so many different web environments](https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/quickstart/), so you're not stuck with using separate tools for different CMSs.
- **More Extensive Docs**:
  - [DDEV Docs](https://docs.ddev.com)
  - [DDEV Quickstarts](https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/quickstart/)
  - [DDEV Installation](https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/install/)
  - [DDEV Configuration](https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/configuration/config/)
  - [Step-Debugging](https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/debugging-profiling/step-debugging/)
  - [DDEV FAQ](https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/faq/)

- **Support the DDEV Project:** DDEV is fully open-source and free to use, and run by the nonprofit DDEV Foundation. We ask you to help make us a sustainable project by sponsoring yourself or getting your organization to sponsor the project. [Sponsor us on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/ddev).
