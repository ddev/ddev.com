## DDEV Training Has Started Up Again!

We're doing training again this season, all are invited. Some sessions are more focused on contributors and maintainers, and others at all users. This month we'll talk about the key magic of hostname resolution, debugging, and DNS. This is critical for everybody in the web world, not just for DDEV users. Join us whatever your experience level is.
