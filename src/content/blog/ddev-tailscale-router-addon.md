[DDEV](https://ddev.com) has transformed local web development by providing containerized environments that eliminate "works on my machine" problems. Its architecture uses `.ddev.site` domains and intelligent routing to prevent port conflicts, enabling multiple projects to run simultaneously. This capability is essential for modern development workflows.

While DDEV excels at local development, today's practices increasingly involve external service integrations requiring stable webhook endpoints, OAuth callbacks, and cross-device testing scenarios. The [`ddev-tailscale-router`](https://github.com/atj4me/ddev-tailscale-router) add-on extends DDEV's capabilities by seamlessly connecting development environments to secure, private networks.

## Extending DDEV's Capabilities for Modern Development Needs

DDEV's containerized architecture brilliantly solves local development complexity through its reverse proxy (ddev-router) system. This design enables multiple projects to coexist without port conflicts, which is essential for modern full-stack development where teams often run frontend, backend, and admin applications simultaneously.

**DDEV's Architectural Strengths:**
- `.ddev.site` domain routing prevents port conflicts across multiple projects
- Container isolation ensures clean, reproducible development environments
- Multi-project support enables complex application architectures
- Minimal configuration local development with automatic service discovery

**Modern Development Requirements:**
Today's development workflows extend beyond single-machine scenarios:

**External Service Integration Needs:**
- **Webhook Development**: Payment processors like [Stripe](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks) and [PayPal](https://developer.paypal.com/docs/api-basics/notifications/webhooks/) require stable, internet-accessible endpoints for testing transaction flows
- **OAuth Implementation**: Social login providers such as [Google](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2), [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps), and [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/) need consistent callback URLs that persist across development sessions
- **API Integration**: Third-party services require reliable endpoint addresses for testing and development

**Individual Developer and Team Requirements:**
- **Cross-Device Testing**: Mobile and tablet testing requires accessing DDEV projects from various devices
- **Client Demonstrations**: Stakeholders benefit from accessing work-in-progress through stable URLs
- **Team Collaboration**: For teams with paid Tailscale plans, secure sharing of development environments becomes possible

**Multi-Project Development Scenarios:**
Decoupled applications typically involve multiple DDEV projects running simultaneously, such as frontend, backend API, and admin dashboard components. While DDEV handles this complexity locally, extending access for cross-device testing and external service integration requires additional networking solutions.

**Available Approaches and Considerations:**

### DDEV's Built-in Sharing Capabilities

DDEV provides excellent built-in sharing through the [`ddev share`](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/topics/sharing/) command, leveraging [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) for instant internet exposure:

**Strengths:**
- One-command activation with `ddev share` (requires ngrok installation and account setup)
- Automatic HTTPS certificate provisioning
- Seamless integration with DDEV's workflow once configured

**Considerations for Extended Use:**
- Free-tier provides one static subdomain (configured via ngrok config), but it's a long, non-memorable URL
- Random URLs are generated when not using the static subdomain configuration
- Webhook and OAuth integrations benefit from more memorable, persistent URLs
- Multi-project architectures may require multiple tunnel instances

### DDEV's Local Network Sharing

DDEV supports local network access through [router configuration](https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/topics/sharing/#exposing-a-host-port-and-providing-a-direct-url):

```bash
ddev config global --router-bind-all-interfaces
```

**Benefits:**
- Enables local network access to DDEV projects
- Maintains DDEV's security model
- No external service dependencies
- Works well for same-network device testing

**Considerations:**
- Requires DNS configuration on other devices for `.ddev.site` resolution
- Limited to devices on the same local network
- May need firewall adjustments for broader access

### Enterprise VPN Solutions

Traditional VPN infrastructure provides comprehensive network access:

**Capabilities:**
- Full network-level access control
- Enterprise-grade security and auditing
- Comprehensive device management

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Server infrastructure and maintenance requirements
- Client configuration complexity for team members
- Ongoing security and certificate management

For development-focused scenarios, lighter weight solutions often provide better developer experience.

## Tailscale: A Modern Networking Solution

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) represents a modern approach to VPN technology, offering zero configuration mesh networking built on [WireGuard's](https://www.wireguard.com/) cryptographic foundation. This approach addresses many traditional VPN limitations:

**Simplified Setup Process**
Tailscale eliminates complex server provisioning by providing [client applications](https://tailscale.com/download) that authenticate through existing identity providers like Google, GitHub, and Microsoft. No certificate management or network configuration is required.

**Secure Mesh Networking**
Devices automatically form encrypted peer-to-peer connections, creating a private network that spans different physical locations and network environments.

**Intuitive Addressing**
[MagicDNS](https://tailscale.com/kb/1081/magicdns/) provides human readable hostnames (such as `device-name.tailnet-name.ts.net`) instead of requiring IP address memorization. This transforms development workflows by providing memorable, stable URLs that work seamlessly across all devices on the Tailscale network.

**Flexible Access Control**
[Tailscale Funnel](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/tailscale-funnel/) enables selective public exposure of services when needed while maintaining private network security by default.

**The DDEV-Tailscale Integration Opportunity**

Tailscale's mesh networking approach perfectly complements DDEV's local development strengths:

- **Enhances DDEV's Multi-Project Capabilities**: Each DDEV project receives its own Tailscale machine with stable hostname addressing
- **Extends DDEV's Reach**: Developers can securely access development environments from any network location
- **Complements DDEV's Architecture**: Works alongside DDEV's existing container ecosystem without disrupting local workflows
- **Supports Modern Development Patterns**: Enables secure access to decoupled applications and microservice architectures
- **Maintains DDEV's Simplicity**: Provides complex networking capabilities through simple configuration

The integration creates a bridge between DDEV's excellent local development experience and the connectivity requirements of modern development workflows. MagicDNS provides intuitive, memorable URLs that eliminate the complexity of IP address management.

## Introducing ddev-tailscale-router

The `ddev-tailscale-router` add-on bridges DDEV's local development capabilities with Tailscale's networking infrastructure. This integration provides a streamlined approach to development environment sharing without requiring networking expertise.

**Core Functionality**

The add-on establishes Tailscale connectivity for DDEV projects through dedicated container deployment:

- **Per-Project Containers**: Each DDEV project gets its own Tailscale container with unique hostname
- **Direct Proxying**: Uses socat to proxy requests directly from Tailscale to the web container
- **Zero Configuration Changes**: Compatible with existing DDEV projects without modification
- **Independent Operation**: Works alongside DDEV's existing networking without interference
- **Granular Privacy Controls**: Supports both private (Tailnet only via Tailscale Serve) and public (internet accessible via Tailscale Funnel) access modes

### Technical Architecture

The add-on implements a per-project Tailscale container approach that works independently of DDEV's router:

1. **Container Orchestration**: Each DDEV project gets its own dedicated Tailscale container
2. **Network Authentication**: Automatic connection to designated Tailscale network using provided authentication keys
3. **Traffic Proxying**: socat proxies incoming Tailscale requests directly to the project's web container
4. **Address Stability**: Each project receives its own persistent Tailscale hostname via MagicDNS
5. **Lifecycle Management**: Tailscale containers start and stop with their respective DDEV projects

### Integration Benefits

**Complements DDEV's Built-in Sharing:**
- Provides persistent URLs ideal for webhook and OAuth development
- Maintains stable endpoints across development session restarts
- Supports multi-project architectures with individual addressing

**Enhances Individual Development and Team Collaboration:**
- Extends DDEV's single-machine excellence to multi-device accessibility
- Private mode (default): tailnet-only access via Tailscale Serve for secure development
- Public mode: internet-wide access via Tailscale Funnel for client demos and external testing

**Strengthens Security Model:**
- Maintains private network principles with optional public exposure
- Provides granular access control through Tailscale's ACL system
- Enables secure sharing without compromising development environment isolation

## Implementation Guide

### Installation Process

The add-on installation follows [DDEV's standard add-on management](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/additional-services/#ddev-add-ons) workflow:

```bash
ddev add-on get atj4me/ddev-tailscale-router
```

### Authentication Configuration

Tailscale integration requires authentication key generation through the administrative interface:

1. Access the [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/settings/keys)
2. Generate a new authentication key (prefix: `tskey-auth-`)
3. Configure the key within the DDEV project environment:

```bash
ddev dotenv set .ddev/.env.tailscale-router --ts-authkey=tskey-auth-your-key-here
ddev restart
```

### Service Access

Once configured, development sites become accessible through Tailscale's MagicDNS hostnames:

1. Navigate to the [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines)
2. Locate the machine entry corresponding to your DDEV project
3. Access the development site using the human-readable hostname

For instance, a project named `myapp` becomes available at `http://myapp-ddev-web.your-tailnet.ts.net`, eliminating the need to remember IP addresses.

## Practical Applications

### Webhook and OAuth Development

Stable endpoint addressing transforms external service integration workflows:

**Payment Webhook Development:**
```
# Stable endpoint for Stripe webhook configuration
http://myapp-ddev-web.your-tailnet.ts.net/webhooks/stripe

# PayPal webhook endpoint
http://myapp-ddev-web.your-tailnet.ts.net/webhooks/paypal

# Square webhook endpoint
http://myapp-ddev-web.your-tailnet.ts.net/webhooks/square

# Human-readable, memorable URLs across development sessions
```

**OAuth Callback Configuration:**
```
# Google OAuth callback
http://myapp-ddev-web.your-tailnet.ts.net/auth/google/callback

# GitHub OAuth callback  
http://myapp-ddev-web.your-tailnet.ts.net/auth/github/callback

# Facebook OAuth callback
http://myapp-ddev-web.your-tailnet.ts.net/auth/facebook/callback

# Microsoft OAuth callback
http://myapp-ddev-web.your-tailnet.ts.net/auth/microsoft/callback
```

This stability eliminates the need for repeated URL updates in external service dashboards, streamlining the development and testing of payment flows and authentication systems.

**For External Testing**: When webhooks need to be accessible from the internet (like Stripe's webhook testing), switch to public mode instead of deploying to a staging server:

```bash
# Enable internet access for webhook testing
ddev dotenv set .ddev/.env.tailscale-router --ts-privacy=public
ddev restart

# Test your webhooks with the public URL
# https://myapp-ddev-web.your-tailnet.ts.net/webhooks/stripe

# Switch back to private mode when testing is complete
ddev dotenv set .ddev/.env.tailscale-router --ts-privacy=private
ddev restart
```

### Cross-Device Testing

The add-on simplifies mobile testing by eliminating manual DNS configuration:

- **Private Mode**: Install Tailscale mobile app for secure cross device access
- **Public Mode**: No app required, access from any internet connected device

### Multi-Project Development

Each DDEV project gets its own Tailscale hostname, enabling access to complete application stacks:

```
# Traditional: frontend.ddev.site (local only)
# With Tailscale: frontend-ddev-web.your-tailnet.ts.net (accessible everywhere)
```

## Access Control: Two Distinct Modes

The add-on provides two access modes through a simple configuration setting:

### Private Mode (Default - Tailscale Serve)

By default, development sites use Tailscale Serve for Tailnet-only access:

```bash
ddev dotenv set .ddev/.env.tailscale-router --ts-privacy=private
ddev restart
```

**Use Cases:**
- Cross-device testing within your Tailnet
- Team collaboration with Tailnet members
- Internal development and testing
- Secure development workflows

### Public Mode (Tailscale Funnel)

For internet-wide access, the add-on uses Tailscale Funnel:

```bash
ddev dotenv set .ddev/.env.tailscale-router --ts-privacy=public
ddev restart
```

**Use Cases:**
- Client demonstrations and feedback sessions
- External webhook testing (Stripe, PayPal, etc.)
- OAuth provider configuration and testing
- Third-party API integration testing
- User acceptance testing with external stakeholders
- Mobile app testing that requires backend APIs

**Why Funnel Outperforms Traditional Staging Deployments:**

Most developers rely on staging servers for external testing, but Tailscale Funnel offers significant advantages:

- **Instant Exposure**: Enable or disable public access in seconds
- **Environment Consistency**: Test exactly what you're developing locally
- **Zero Infrastructure**: Eliminates staging servers and deployment pipelines
- **Cost Effective**: No additional hosting costs
- **Security Control**: Easily revoke access when testing is complete

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Compatibility

The add-on currently supports Linux and Windows with [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/). Support for macOS and ARM64 (Apple Silicon) platforms is under active development.

### Protocol Support

The add-on provides both HTTP and HTTPS access to development sites. Tailscale Serve (private mode) and Tailscale Funnel (public mode) both automatically provide HTTPS endpoints with valid certificates, eliminating the need for manual certificate configuration.

### Performance Characteristics

Tailscale's WireGuard-based routing introduces minimal latency overhead that's typically imperceptible during development. Network performance remains well-suited for standard development workflows, including real-time debugging and asset reloading.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### URL Discovery Issues
Verify project machine registration in the [Tailscale admin console](https://login.tailscale.com/admin/machines) and confirm hostname assignment. MagicDNS hostnames follow the pattern `[project-name]-ddev-web.[tailnet-name].ts.net`.

### Application Display Problems
Some applications that generate `localhost` or `.ddev.site` URLs may require base URL configuration updates to use Tailscale hostnames instead. This is particularly common in CMS applications like [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/support/article/changing-the-site-url/) and [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/docs/administering-a-drupal-site/site-configuration/changing-the-site-url), as well as frameworks that store base URLs in configuration files or databases.

### Network Connectivity Issues
If you cannot access your development site through the Tailscale hostname, verify that:
- The Tailscale container is running: `ddev logs -s tailscale-router`
- Your authentication key is valid and properly configured
- MagicDNS is enabled in your Tailscale network settings
- The project name matches the hostname pattern in the admin console

### Authentication Failures
Confirm authentication key validity and proper environment variable configuration through [DDEV's dotenv system](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/extend/customization-extendibility/#providing-custom-environment-variables-to-a-container).
