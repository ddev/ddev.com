Docker providers for macOS have been getting better and faster (mostly) over time. It's time to take a look and see what is happening with performance.

I used mostly the same technique as in [December 2022](/blog/ddev-docker-desktop-and-colima-benchmarking-updated-dec-2022/) and previous tests.


The test does a Drupal 10 web install (details below), because it's a heavy test that exercises the database and filesystem extensiively. 

We'll start with Mutagen enabled (`ddev config --performance-mode=mutagen`), which is the default for macOS. You'll see that OrbStack has the fastest setup, but that all five of the configurations are in a similar range. You would probably be happy with any of them.

Now, with Mutagen disabled (`ddev config --performance-mode=none`), OrbStack is by far the fastest, with Docker Desktop coming next and Rancher Desktop and Colima (both configurations) looking pretty sluggish. It's possible that OrbStack could be used without Mutagen, but I don't have any experience with that. Colima with SSHFS definitely cannot be used without Mutagen due to consistency problems with SSHFS.

## The Test

I used the[ddev-puppeteer](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-puppeteer) project to run the tests. Want to try it against your system or configuration? I'd love to hear your results.

See the [spreadsheet with the raw data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14d79oUItssfB1_spUjjGOPkhumARXyhF0DNBK1kp2KA/edit?usp=sharing)

* PHP 8.1
* MacBook Air (M1, 2020), 16GB RAM, plugged in
* Docker Desktop 4.25.2
* Colima v0.6.6, Lima v0.18.0, QEMU 8.1.3 (`colima start qemutest --cpu 4 --memory 6 --disk 100 --dns=1.1.1.1 --vm-type=qemu --mount-type=sshfs` and `colima start vztest --cpu=4 --memory=6 --disk=100 --mount-type=virtiofs`)
