## DDEV at DrupalCon Atlanta 2025

I wasn't involved with any of the formal sessions, but as has been my habit I scheduled a number of "BoFs", or Birds-of-a-Feather sessions:

* **DDEV VS Code Integration Improvement**: We talked about ways that DDEV could integrate better with VS Code. Although the ......

* **Divide and conquer: A systematic approach to troubleshooting issues**: ... link to Florida and the repo ...

## First-time Contributor Mentoring

The highlight of every DrupalCon is helping new contributors on Contribution Day, a whole day where folks get help doing their first work contributing to code or docs or marketing. I was able to help a few people and of course was the resident DDEV and DrupalPod expert. 

## Helping Out

I published an invitation to meet one-on-one and a few people took advantage of meeting in person to look at their DDEV issues. It was great to meet them!

## Notes

* **Drupal CMS was all the rage**: The [Drupal CMS](https://new.drupal.org/docs/drupal-cms) project has been quite successful this year, and it seemed like dozens of sessions talked about it. It seems to me like the Drupal community has taken an excellent path with this. As Dries said in the [Driesnote](https://dri.es/state-of-drupal-presentation-march-2025), Drupal was always a huge bunch of building blocks that could do lots of things and do them well... but only experts understood how to do that. And they all did it in different ways. Now Drupal CMS provides a clear and refined starting point for people who need a website, but still has all the power of Drupal behind it, and you don't have to be an expert to get that polish and those features at the very beginning of your journey.
* **DDEV Maintainer [Stas Zhuk](https://github.com/stasadev)** can't travel outside Ukraine, but he was welcomed with an honorary badge! ![Stas with badge](/img/blog/2025/04/stas-sort-of-at-drupalcon-atlanta.png)
* **Docksal seems to be in trouble**: In the Drupal community many folks have happily used [Docksal](https://docksal.io/) over the years, but its maintenance has recently fallen off. (Docksal is a Docker-based local development environment similar to DDEV.) There were people at DrupalCon asking about the situation with Docksal and asking for help migrating their sites to DDEV because of frustration with the project, which hasn't had a release since May, 2024. As open-source maintainers ourselves, we understand the pressures of maintenance and life and hope the Docksal maintainers are getting all the support they need in both places.

## Thanks!

[Bernardo Martinez](https://www.drupal.org/u/bernardm28) shared a room and a Drupalcon ticket, making this whole thing possible.

[Platform.sh](https://platform.sh) was kind enough to fund the airline ticket to Atlanta.

Thanks to both of you! I wouldn't have made it without both those things.
