We all want DDEV to be fully maintained at the level you depend on. Now is the time to fully fund maintainer Stas Zhuk so that he does not have to take on other client work. 

**DDEV's Funding**: DDEV is funded a variety of ways. [Platform.sh covers Randy's salary](platform-sh-becomes-a-lead-sponsor-of-ddev.md), thanks! Individuals and organization sponsors fund DDEV via [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/ddev) and invoiced support commitments. As the pace of required maintenance and features has increased, we've explained how we intend to grow our maintainership for the long-term in a [couple](recruiting-maintainers.md) of [blog posts](expanding-ddev-maintainer-team.md). (DDEV's "fiscal entity" for funding is the US 501(c)(3) [DDEV Foundation](/foundation)).

**Stas' Role as DDEV Maintainer**: In November, 2023, we [introduced Stas to the community](introducing-maintainer-stas.md) as our second maintainer. Since then, he's done amazing things, working as a part-time paid maintainer. He knows how all the testing and other infrastructure works, has mastered the Golang and Docker codebase, and has contributed hundreds of bug fixes, features, and documentation improvements. As of today, he has contributed [211 commits](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/graphs/contributors) to the master branch of the `ddev/ddev` project alone, second only through the whole history of DDEV to yours truly. Take a look at his [600+](https://github.com/stasadev?tab=overview&from=2024-07-01&to=2024-07-31&org=ddev) contributions to the DDEV org **just in 2024**.
