## What is the Open Source Pledge?

Open-source software powers a massive part of the digital economy, but its sustainability (as with DDEV) often relies on voluntary contributions, which can be precarious. The [Open Source Pledge](https://opensourcepledge.com/) offers a framework for organizations to support the tools they rely on, setting an industry standard of USD$2000/developer/year to fund open-source projects. The idea is to establish sustainable funding and ensure the longevity of vital projects like DDEV and all the upstream projects it depends on.

## DDEV’s Sustainability Goals

DDEV is a powerful local development environment designed for developers working with CMS platforms and e-commerce systems. Like many open-source tools, DDEV thrives on community contributions and volunteer maintainers. However, this model limits the ability to scale development efforts. To address this, we’ve been exploring ways to fund maintainers like key maintainer Stas Zhuk: [Let’s Fully Fund Maintainer Stas](lets-fund-stas-maintainer.md).

The Open Source Pledge aligns with DDEV’s goals by setting a clear benchmark for funding. Agencies and other organizations that rely on DDEV as part of their toolchain can use this pledge to estimate their contribution to projects they depend on.

## Price Anchoring: Why $2000 Matters

The USD$2000 per-developer per-year price point serves as a clear anchor, guiding organizations to think practically about supporting open source. Consider a web development agency using DDEV alongside other tools like CMS platforms, CI/CD systems, and libraries. If DDEV represents 10% of their overall toolchain, the agency might allocate $200 per developer per year to support DDEV.

While the percentage will vary, the Open Source Pledge provides a starting point for companies to quantify their support. For DDEV, this transparency can bridge the gap between reliance and sustainability.

## Challenges with Current Models

Tools like [thanks.dev](https://thanks.dev) and [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com/) attempt to address open-source funding by analyzing build files and distributing donations. While effective for libraries, these models fall short for tools like DDEV, which exist outside dependency management systems.

DDEV isn’t listed in `package.json` or `composer.json` files; it’s an environment where development happens. This distinction means DDEV doesn’t benefit from algorithmic funding models, making direct acknowledgment and support from users critical.

## A Call to Action

For companies and agencies using DDEV, adopting the Open Source Pledge isn’t just about numbers -- it’s about recognizing the value of all the tools that enable your success. By taking the pledge, you’re contributing to the sustainability of an ecosystem that empowers your work.

1. Sign the [Open Source Pledge](https://opensourcepledge.com/join/)
2. Choose the portion that should be allocated to make DDEV a sustainable project and commit to its funding.

We know that these choices require organizational action, and we're happy to help communication with your organization. DDEV's financial affairs are handled through the US nonprofit [DDEV Foundation](/foundation) so it's easy to fund, with clear management and reporting. We're happy to talk to your boss about any facet of this process, see the [Contact page](/contact).

## Look to the Future!

Imagine a day when the tools you rely on for development--like DDEV--suddenly (or gradually) stop working reliably. You've seen this happen before. Without sustainable funding, this could be a reality for countless open-source projects. We must all work together to support this critical ecosystem. You count on expert, up-to-date maintenance and improvement of the project to support your clients. It's time to figure out how to make that maintenance sustainable.
