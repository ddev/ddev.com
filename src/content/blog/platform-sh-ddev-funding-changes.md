As many of you know, [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh) is a key supporter and funder of DDEV. They generously stepped in to become the lead sponsor of DDEV and rescue the "DDEV" trademark and its use [in 2022](platform-sh-becomes-a-lead-sponsor-of-ddev.md).

Of course, time moves along and sometimes organizations have to change their priorities, and in 2025 Platform.sh has decided to change its approach, but still remains a generous lead sponsor at the _partner_ level. (Your organization can join them!)

- Instead of funding maintainer Randy Fay as an employee, Platform.sh will fund the DDEV Foundation with a generous €3000/month.
- Platform.sh will transfer the "DDEV" trademark and control of the `ddev.com` and `ddev.site` domain names to the DDEV Foundation.
- We'll continue to maintain the [ddev-platformsh](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-platformsh) add-on and explore an [Upsun](https://upsun.com) add-on.

We don't want to sugar-coat this too much. On the one hand, this is a reduction of about 60% in Platform's support of DDEV, and it will be an ongoing challenge to replace it. But on the other hand, Platform's generous ongoing support will still amount to about 50% of our total income.

We'll be preparing updated financial plans for 2025 to adjust to this change, and continue to be enormously thankful for the support of Platform.sh!

This change in funding mode does give DDEV more flexibility in use of funds, and with the flexibility we can hope to move toward [full support for Stas Zhuk](lets-fund-stas-maintainer.md). The obvious problem is that now we have to budget for both Stas and Randy, with less resources.

As many of you know, though, times are tight in the agency world, and funding for DDEV has actually declined in other ways over the last year, with several key sponsors having to back away. We hope you and your organization are coming up with new plans to support DDEV.

**THANKS to all of you who are supporting DDEV’s path to sustainability** and who have gotten your organizations to do so.

**Stop by and thank Platform.sh** for their generous ongoing support of DDEV! See their [contact page](https://platform.sh/contact/) or join their [Discord](https://discord.gg/platformsh).
