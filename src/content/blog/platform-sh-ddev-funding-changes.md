As many of you know, [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh) is a key supporter and funder of DDEV. They generously stepped in to and to become the lead sponsor of DDEV and to rescue the "DDEV" trademark and its use [in 2022](platform-sh-becomes-a-lead-sponsor-of-ddev.md). 

Of course, time moves along and sometimes organizations have to change their priorities, and in 2025 Platform.sh has decided to change its approach, but still remains a generous lead sponsor at the *partner* level. (Your organization can join them!)

* Instead of funding maintainer Randy Fay as an employee, Platform.sh will fund the DDEV Foundation with a generous 3000 Euros/month.
* Platform.sh will transfer the "DDEV" trademark and control of the `ddev.com` and `ddev.site` domain names to the DDEV Foundation.
* We'll continue to maintain the [ddev-platformsh](https://github.com/ddev/ddev-platformsh) add-on and explore an [Upsun](https://upsun.com) add-on.

We'll be preparing updated financial plans for 2025 to adjust to this change, and continue to be enormously thankful for the support of Platform.sh!

This change in funding mode will give DDEV more flexibility in use of funds, and is expected to be a solid move to [full support for Stas Zhuk](lets-fund-stas-maintainer.md).

As many of you know, though, times are tight in the agency world, and funding for DDEV has actually declined in the last year, with a couple of key sponsors having to back away. We hope you and your organization are coming up with new plans to support DDEV.

**THANKS to all of you who are supporting DDEVâ€™s path to sustainability** and who have gotten your organizations to do so.

**Stop by and thank Platform.sh** for their generous ongoing support of DDEV! See their [contact page](https://platform.sh/contact/) or join their [discord](https://discord.gg/platformsh).
