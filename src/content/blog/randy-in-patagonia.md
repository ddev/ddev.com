Some of you know that my wife Nancy and I have done lots of pretty ambitious bike touring over the last 20 years or so. From 2006-2009, [we rode 14,000 miles
](https://hobobiker.com)(22,000 km) through the Americas from near the Arctic Ocean in Canada to Puerto Montt in Patagonian Chile, South America.  

Well, we've wanted to go back to South America and complete a part of what's missing there, and this year we decided to do it. Tomorrow (December 2, 2023) we fly to Puerto Montt and will start our bike trip shortly.

We plan to be on our bikes all of December and January, returning home at the end of January, 2024.

## What does this mean to DDEV? Will we be OK?

Are you asking "What happens to DDEV?" - Well we've been [working on that](https://ddev.com/blog/expanding-ddev-maintainer-team) for a couple of years now. Thanks to the DDEV community's generous support, we have an additional, highly skilled maintainer, [Stas Zhuk](https://ddev.com/blog/introducing-maintainer-stas/) and of course we are a community all the time, supporting one another. I'll be checking in when I can, but there isn't really any internet between towns in Patagonia, and we'll be riding and camping a lot. You will be in great hands with Stas and the community.

## How Can I Follow Along?

You can follow us on our [facebook](https://facebook.com/randyfay). We'd love to have you.

You should also be able to see exactly where we are on [share.garmin.com](https://share.garmin.com/randynancy).

## What's the Route?

Our basic plan is the route marked in yellow "True Carretera Austral" on [A Guide to Cycling the Carretera Austral](https://thecarreteraaustral.wordpress.com/route/). The basic idea is to go as far as you can go south in Chile (to Villa O'Higgins) and then cross into Argentina via a dirt track used by bikes and hikers only, and continue on to Puerto Natales, where we'll take a ferry back to Puerto Montt. It should end up being about 1200 miles (1900 km).

We're looking forward to having you along with us. Thanks for your support of DDEV and the DDEV community! We'll be back at the end of January, 2024.

## Making DDEV Sustainable in the Long Term

Don't forget that one of DDEV's big goals is financial and community sustainability over the long term. We all know no individual will be around forever, and we want our favorite projects and communities to continue on even when change is all around us. [Join us in working toward that sustainabililty goal](/support-ddev/#sponsor-development).
