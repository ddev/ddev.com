### How to Apply

You don't actually "apply," you grow into these positions. But if becoming a maintainer is interesting to you, let's talk about it and make a plan! We'll mentor you, give you responsibilities commensurate with your capabililties, and help you grow into the role. If you're a PHP developer, you can learn go enough to make significant contributions in a modest amount of time. But perhaps most of the DDEV project is a variety of miscellaneous technologies that you may already have experience with. And understanding the web developer is a fundamental part of DDEV, so if you're a web developer you're already part of the way there.
