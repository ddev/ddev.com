## Thank you!

We just want to take a moment to thank all of the amazing sponsors of the DDEV open source project. All of you reading this know that we've been working for years now to make DDEV a financially sustainable project, so it can serve you into the future. So many have responded to that call. Thank you!

## Major Sponsors

* [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh) has been a major sponsor of DDEV. You may know that they recently reduced their sponsorship, but they remain our largest single supporter, and we appreciate it greatly. Platform.sh has also transferred the "ddev" domain names to the [DDEV Foundation](/foundation) and will be transferring the "DDEV" trademark.
* [Tag1 Consulting](https://tag1consulting.com) stepped up to generously support DDEV at a very significant level so many years ago, and has continued doing that. And they don't just offer outstanding financial support, they're always making clear that they use and support DDEV, and we get to see them at conferences.
* Mobilistics, i-gelb (500+/month)
* Lullabot, Affinity Bridge, claudiu-cristea, FameHelsinki, OPTASY, Gizra, Healthcare without Harm, Cambrico, Agaric, Centarro, Pixel & Tonic
* B13 (2000/year)
