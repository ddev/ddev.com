## Thank you!

We just want to take a moment to thank all of the amazing sponsors of the DDEV open source project. All of you reading this know that we've been working for years now to make DDEV a financially sustainable project, so it can serve you into the future. So many have responded to that call. Thank you!

**Even though we're going to mention the biggest sponsors first, we want all of you to know that your sponsorship matters too, and with care we can expand to many, many small sponsors to ensure DDEV's resilience and sustainability.**

## Major Sponsors

* [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh) has been a major sponsor of DDEV for a few years now. You may know that they recently reduced their sponsorship, but they remain our largest single supporter, and we appreciate it greatly. Platform.sh has also transferred the "ddev" domain names to the [DDEV Foundation](/foundation) and will be transferring the "DDEV" trademark. And they're funding Randy's plane ticket to Drupalcon Atlanta!
* [Tag1 Consulting](https://tag1consulting.com) stepped up to generously support DDEV at a very significant level so many years ago, and has continued doing that. And they don't just offer outstanding financial support, they're always making clear that they use and support DDEV, and we get to see them at conferences.
* [Mobilistics](https://mobilistics.de/) and [i-gelb](https://i-gelb.net) both sponsor at the $500/month level.
* All these lovely organizations sponsor at the $100/month (or a bit higher) level: [Lullabot](https://lullabot.com), [Affinity Bridge](https://affinitybridge.com/), [Webikon](https://github.com/claudiu-cristea), [FameHelsinki](https://fame.fi/), [OPTASY](https://www.optasy.com/), [Gizra](https://gizra.com), [Healthcare without Harm](https://noharm.org/), [Cambrico](https://cambrico.net/), [Agaric](https://agaric.coop), [Centarro](https://centarro.io), [Craft CMS](https://craftcms.com/), [Redfin Solutions](https://redfinsolutions.com/), [b13](https://b13.com)

## So many more wonderful sponsors!


## In-Kind Sponsors

The open-source community has lots of folks helping out multiple collaborators. In our case, [MacStadium](https://macstadium.com) provides us testing resources, and [JetBrains](https://jetbrains.com) provides a subscription to their IDE products, thanks! 

But we never forget Docker. Docker has adopted us in the Docker-Sponsored-Open-Source program for a few years now, and this means that all of your image pulls are sponsored in that project. You may know that normal image pulls will be strictly limited starting April 1, 2024, but because of the DSOS, users of DDEV won't hit that restriction.

And please don't forget that the [open-source Docker project](https://github.com/moby/moby) underlies every single Docker provider. It doesn't matter if you're using OrbStack or Lima or Docker Desktop or whatever, they're all built on top of the amazing Docker open-source project.
