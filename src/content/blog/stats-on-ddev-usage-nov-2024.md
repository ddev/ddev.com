**You can explore these yourself, ask for permission.** If you're a known community member I'll happily add your access to Amplitude to explore. There are many more things that can be done with this. See [Amplitude](cont)

**THANKS to all of you who are supporting DDEVâ€™s path to sustainability** and who have gotten your organizations to do so. 13,600 or so of you are using this tool and ecosystem weekly, about 55 of you are financially supporting its sustainability.
