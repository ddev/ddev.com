I've found that DDEV's [`ddev share`](https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/topics/sharing/) command is a great way to quickly share my local development environment. However, since it uses ngrok, it requires ngrok to be installed on the host system and generates a new, random URL every time unless you use a [stable domain](https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/topics/sharing/#setting-up-a-stable-ngrok-domain). As an alternative, I've created the [`ddev-tailscale-router`](https://github.com/atj4me/ddev-tailscale-router) add-on.

This add-on uses [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/), a VPN service that creates a private and secure network between your devices. It is free for personal use and doesn't require any additional software to be installed on your host system!

As a result, you get a stable, human-readable URL for each of your DDEV projects, which you can access from any device on your Tailscale network.

I've found this approach to be particularly useful for:

- **Cross-device testing:** I can easily test my sites on my phone or tablet without being on the same Wi-Fi network.
- **Stable webhook URLs:** I can use the permanent Tailscale URL as a reliable endpoint for webhooks, such as those from payment gateways.
- **Team collaboration:** I can share my development environment with team members so they can see my work in progress.

### How it Works

The `ddev-tailscale-router` add-on works by installing Tailscale directly into your DDEV project's web container using userspace networking. This approach provides better macOS compatibility and improved reliability compared to running a separate container. The add-on automatically connects to your Tailscale network and securely proxies requests to your project.

> **Update:** Version 3.0.0 brought significant architectural improvements! The add-on now uses YAML-based configuration, improved command structure, and better error handling. If you're upgrading from an earlier version, see the [migration instructions](https://github.com/atj4me/ddev-tailscale-router/releases/tag/v3.0.0) in the release notes.

### Prerequisites

Before installing the add-on, you need to set up Tailscale:

1. **Install Tailscale** on at least two devices (phone, tablet, or computer) by following the [installation guide](https://tailscale.com/download). This is required to generate an auth key.
2. **Enable HTTPS** by following the [Tailscale HTTPS documentation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1153/enabling-https). This is required for TLS certificate generation.
3. **Generate an auth key** by following the [Tailscale auth keys documentation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1085/auth-keys). Ephemeral, reusable keys are recommended.

### Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1.  First, **set up your auth key** (recommended approach):
    Add the auth key to your shell environment:

    ```bash
    echo 'export TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-your-key-here' >> ~/.bashrc
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

    Replace `~/.bashrc` with `~/.zshrc` if you use Zsh, or your relevant shell configuration file.

    Alternatively, you can use interactive authentication after installation by running `ddev tailscale login` after your project starts.

2.  Next, **install the add-on:**

    ```bash
    ddev add-on get atj4me/ddev-tailscale-router
    ```

3.  Finally, **restart DDEV:**
    ```bash
    ddev restart
    ```

### Using Your Tailscale URL

Once installation is complete, you need to start sharing your project:

Start sharing your project:

```bash
ddev tailscale share
```

Launch your project's Tailscale URL in browser:

```bash
ddev tailscale launch
```

Get your project's Tailscale URL:

```bash
ddev tailscale url
```

Your project's permanent Tailscale URL will look like: `https://<project-name>.<your-tailnet>.ts.net`. You can also find it in your Tailscale admin console.

To see all available commands and options, run `ddev tailscale help`. This will show you both the DDEV-specific shortcuts and all native Tailscale CLI commands that you can use.

### Public vs. Private Mode

The add-on offers two modes for sharing your project:

- **Private (default):** Your project is only accessible to devices on your Tailscale network.
- **Public:** Your project is accessible to anyone on the internet.

To switch between modes:

Share publicly (accessible to anyone on the internet):

```bash
ddev tailscale share --public
```

Share privately (default, only accessible to your Tailscale devices):

```bash
ddev tailscale share
```

Stop sharing:

```bash
ddev tailscale stop
```

> **Note:** For public access, you need to configure your [Access Control List (ACL)](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel#funnel-node-attribute) to enable Funnel. See the [Tailscale Funnel documentation](https://tailscale.com/kb/1223/funnel) for details on setting up the required ACL policy.

### Uninstalling the Add-on

If you need to remove the add-on from your project:

1. **Stop any active sharing:**

   ```bash
   ddev tailscale stop
   ```

2. **Remove the add-on:**

   ```bash
   ddev add-on remove tailscale-router
   ```

3. **Restart DDEV:**
   ```bash
   ddev restart
   ```
