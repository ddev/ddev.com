**TL;DR** Upsun has been (and remains) a great sponsor of DDEV, but is lowering their support level next month. We need you to fill the gap!

I don't know if you remember how much Upsun (formerly Platform.sh) has helped DDEV along the way. When we were about to lose the ability to use the "DDEV" name, they stepped in and solved the problem. Then they supported DDEV as a very high level for a couple of years, and during the last year at a somewhat lower level. They have also managed the DDEV trademark and are now transferring it to the DDEV Foundation.

Starting next month, due to changing priorities, Upsun will be lowering their sponsorship level to the $1000/month level, still one of our most critical sponsors, but leaving a big hole in our funding.
