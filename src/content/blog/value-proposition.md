We're preparing to do a fund drive for the DDEV Project, and want to make sure that we explain clearly to potential funders and donors what makes it worth putting actual money into. This article is an attempt to explain that. 

DDEV stands out as a comprehensive solution to the challenges of local web development. It not only offers a pre-configured, containerized environment that takes away the complexities of setting up and managing local development systems but also brings unique attributes that make local web development a breeze.

DDEV distinguishes itself through its powerful, open source, Docker-based local development solution. This solution is versatile, able to adapt to various platforms and technologies, and highly efficient, saving users significant time that might be spent on building and maintaining custom Docker environments.

## What Sets DDEV Apart

- **Simplicity and Speed**: DDEV is designed to get you up and running quickly. Installation is easy on every supported OS, and adding it to a new project can take as little as ten seconds. This allows developers to focus more on coding and less on configuration. It's fast to install, fast to start using, fast to use on a new project, and does superbly fast webserving.

- **Multi-project and Multi-technology Support**: Unlike many local development environments that are tied to specific platforms or technologies, DDEV is versatile, allowing you to run multiple projects concurrently with different technology stacks, and supports multiple OSs and architectures, including macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel), Linux, Windows WSL2 and traditional Windows. Team members can have different computers and still work consistently on the same projects. One developer can have ten projects running at the same time, with each using different setups, including different PHP or Python versions, different Node.js versions, different databases, and different web servers.

- **Consistency Across Teams**: Most teams check in and manage their DDEV configuration. This reduces discrepancies and eliminates "works on my machine" problems, enhancing team collaboration and making it easier to onboard new team members. Your configuration is checked in and managed for the entire team. Onboarding of new members often takes only a few minutes, even with diverse operating systems and hardware.

- **Customization and Flexibility**: DDEV comes pre-configured for many common types of projects, but also supports customized configurations. This versatility enables it to accommodate any specific project needs, giving you the freedom to tailor your environment as you wish. An [entire selection of add-ons](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/latest/users/extend/additional-services/) is maintained by the team and the community to extend DDEV with technologies not built into the core product.

- **Built-in web server and Database Services**: With DDEV, there's no need to install and configure web servers or database services manually. Everything you need is included and pre-configured, ready to go when you need it, supporting both Nginx and Apache, along with MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.

- **Community and Support**: DDEV's great strength is its community - YOU. Its strength has always been community input and iteration. And we provide world-class support, including comprehensive documentation, tutorials, and an active, engaged community. This ensures our users are never left in the dark and can make the most out of our platform.
- 
- **Maintenance**: When a new computer architecture or a new PHP version or a new database version comes along, DDEV is right there with you, making sure you have the tools you need. 

Feedback and testimonials from our users — ranging from web agencies and organizations to individual developers — attest to the transformative impact of DDEV. It's more than a tool; it's a game-changer in web development, empowering developers and teams to streamline their workflows, reduce friction, and foster more creativity and innovation. By offering this powerful, free solution, DDEV reaffirms its commitment to the global developer community.
