This screencast walks you through setting up a complete DDEV development environment on Windows using WSL2, starting completely from scratch. Whether you're new to DDEV, WSL2, or local development environments in general, this step-by-step guide will get you up and running quickly.

## What You'll Learn

**DDEV Fundamentals**: Understanding what DDEV is and why it's become the go-to solution for local web development. The video explains that DDEV is a Docker-based local development environment aimed at web developers, mostly PHP and Node developers. Key benefits include:

- Developers can run websites on their local computer with almost no configuration
- Multiple projects can run simultaneously, each with different configurations
- Docker handles all the heavy lifting, so you don't even need PHP or Composer or Node on your host computer
- First-class support across macOS, Linux, Windows, and WSL2 - it works the same on every platform

**WSL2 Setup and Benefits**: WSL2 ([Windows Subsystem for Linux version 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/)) transforms Windows development by providing a real Linux kernel running alongside Windows. The video covers the key advantages and considerations:

_Advantages:_

- Complete Linux environment on your Windows machine - fast and capable
- Amazingly fast web serving with DDEV/Docker CE
- You're working with an environment much like the one you'll deploy to

_Considerations:_

- Linux on your Windows machine means yet another system to learn and remember
- Context switches between Windows and WSL2 environments
- You must work in the WSL2 filesystem rather than Windows filesystem (optimized for web apps, not Microsoft Word)

**Complete Installation Process**: The video covers [every step](/get-started) of the installation process, including:

- Setting up WSL2 from scratch using the `wsl --install` command
- Running the new DDEV Windows installer that automatically configures your distro for Docker CE
- Understanding why you need to work in the WSL2 file system instead of the Windows NTFS filesystem for optimal performance

**Real-World Usage**: Beyond just installation, you'll see DDEV in action with:

- Creating a simple PHP project and launching it with trusted HTTPS certificates
- Installing Drupal 11 using `ddev composer create-project`
- Essential DDEV commands like `ddev describe`, `ddev snapshot`, and `ddev export-db`
- Advanced IDE integration with both PhpStorm and VS Code, including Xdebug debugging

**Professional Development Features**: The video demonstrates advanced workflows including:

- Setting up Xdebug debugging in both PhpStorm and VS Code
- Working with DDEV projects from within WSL2-integrated IDEs
- Understanding Docker Desktop vs Docker CE trade-offs for professional development
- Best practices for file system performance and cross-platform compatibility

This screencast follows the official DDEV [WSL2 Installation Docs](https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/install/ddev-installation/#ddev-installation-windows), but provides additional context, troubleshooting tips, and real-world examples to ensure your success.
