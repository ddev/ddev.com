Tired of those complex PowerShell scripts we used to provide to get DDEV running on Windows? The new GUI installer changes everything.

In [DDEV v1.24.7](https://github.com/ddev/ddev/releases/tag/v1.24.7) we've eliminated the complexity of Windows setup. What used to require a privileged  PowerShell script and manual WSL2 configuration now takes just a few clicks.

## Why This Changes Everything for DDEV Developers on Windows

✅ **Almost No Command Line Required for Setup**<br/>
✅ **Handles WSL2 Setup Automatically** - No more manual configuration<br/>
✅ **Works with Your Preferred Docker Setup** - Docker Desktop, Rancher Desktop, or Docker-CE, in WSL2 or with Traditional Windows<br/>
✅ **Beginner-Friendly** - Perfect for developers new to DDEV

The new installer supports:

* WSL2 Docker-CE
* WSL2 Docker Desktop and Rancher Desktop
* Traditional Windows installation

## See It In Action

Watch me transform a fresh Windows machine into a fully functional DDEV development environment in about 10 minutes:

**What you'll see:**
- Starting from a Windows machine without WSL2
- Complete WSL2 and Docker CE setup
- DDEV installation and first project
- Ready to develop in 10 minutes

**Cross-Platform Compatibility:** DDEV works the same on macOS, Linux, Traditional Windows, and WSL2, see [Getting Started](/get-started). Your whole team can work on their preferred environment instead of fighting about it. It supports development of [so many different web environments](https://ddev.readthedocs.io/en/stable/users/quickstart/), so you're not stuck with using different tools for different CMSs.

**Support the Project:** DDEV is fully open-source and free to use, and run by the nonprofit DDEV Foundation. We ask you to help make us a sustainable project by sponsoring yourself or getting your organization to sponsor the project. [Sponsor us on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/ddev).
