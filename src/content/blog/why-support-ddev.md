The DDEV project is committed to setting itself to be sustainable for the long term. We know that your choice of a tool is a signficant investment of resources, and we want your choice to last and be rewarding for the long term. In order to ensure that, we're doing a fund drive, explaining to teams, organizations, and individuals why it's important to financially support the project. Our key priority right now is adding [another paid maintainer](recruiting-maintainers.md) and a documentation/marketing maintainer. We'll be be updating you regularly about this initiative.

## What Sets DDEV Apart

- **Installation**: DDEV is easy to install. It's a single binary backed by Docker providers everywhere.
- **Project Setup**: Adding DDEV to a project is as easy as `ddev config` and can take as little as a minute.
- **Reliability**: DDEV's behavior is predictable and reliable. Automated testing on all supported platforms and manual testing of every new feature make it rock solid.
- **Multiple OS/Architecture Support**: Even if your team members use macOS (Apple Silicon or Intel), Windows WSL2, Linux, and traditional Windows you can expect consistent behavior across all these environments for the entire team.
- **Team Consistency**: Teams typically check in the DDEV configuration, meaning that team members can check out the project and `ddev start` and they'll have everything running right away in less than a minute.
- **Web server and Database Support**: Out of the box, DDEV supports Nginx and Apache webservers, and directly supports MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL databases.
- **Add-On Ecosystem**: A huge number of non-core features are supported via add-ons, including Apache Solr, Elasticsearch, and dozens of others. There are officially supported add-ons and a large number contributed and maintained by the community.
- **Community**: DDEV's friendly and active community meets in Discord, the GitHub issue queue, and Stack Overflow. People from many different CMS and framework communities have years of experience and help each other.
- **Support**: DDEV's support is world-class and very active. Questions in the issue queue are often answered in minutes. Problems in Discord are often discussed and resolved very, very quickly. Bugs get early attention.
- **Maintenance**: Careful maintenance means that new upstream capabilities (PHP versions, other tool changes) and upstream bugs get resolved and tested soon. Extensive automated testing means that upstream problems are detected quickly.
- **Open Source**: DDEV is completely Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). It also can work with FOSS Docker providers on every platform, so you're not tied to closed-source commercial solutions like Docker Desktop, although Docker Desktop is fully supported.

**We invite you to calculate the value DDEV brings to your work and consider making a financial contribution to support the project.** DDEV consistently delivers on the promise of making local development work for your projects, every time. How much time, energy, and resources do you save by using DDEV as opposed to maintaining your own solution or using an alternate? What would it cost to achieve the same efficiency and consistency without DDEV? Please calculate that value for yourself as you're considering how to financially support the project.
