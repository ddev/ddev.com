I've recently set up a few Windows machines for DDEV maintenance and development, and wanted to share how I do it. It's surprisingly easy. My approach here is opinionated, but it works for me. You'll do things a little differently I'm sure.

Two recent Windows machines I set up were the new ARM64/Qualcomm/CoPilot variety. They were excellent and fast and had great battery life. There's very little I had to do differently with them, but I'll mention in the steps when there was something different. (I was surprised by the lack of a fingerprint sensor on both, but the Windows Hello facial recognition was quite fast. There is no ARM64 Discord app, and the AMD64 one had horrific performance.)
