          <p>
            DDEV is a local development environment for web developers. It
            originated within the company “Drud” in about 2016. Drud was
            building a general-purpose CLI for its infant web hosting product
            (named “DDEV-Live”, with the local dev tool named “DDEV-Local”), and
            the and was visionary enough to build local development into the
            idea. (Nobody really remembers what “DDEV” stands for, it might be
            “Docker development” or it might have been “Drud development”.)
          </p>

          <p>
            The independent value of the tool was soon recognized and it was
            refactored into its own repository, and then made open-source and it
            began its journey. Randy Fay was an employee of Drud in this period,
            and as a long-time proponent of local development and debugging was
            sold on its value. Drud graciously sponsored Randy to work on DDEV
            for nearly five years, until it lost its funding. DDEV of course had
            integration to Drud’s hosting product during this period, and it was
            seen as a way to bring developers into the Drud-hosting world.
          </p>

          <p>
            The company Drud (by then renamed “DDEV”) shut down in 2021 when it
            lost its venture funding. Randy Fay continued to maintain the
            project without interruption.
